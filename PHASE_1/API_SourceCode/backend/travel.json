     "summary":"<p>Authorities have periodically relied on strict lockdown measures and mass testing in areas with suspected COVID-19 cases, since the outbreak was first detected in Wuhan, Hubei province in late 2019. Health screening and sanitary measures have since been implemented in transportation hubs and other urban areas with international borders also open to essential travellers from several countries. While a new wave of infections and related movement restrictions have been intermittently imposed in Beijing, Shanghai and other areas since early March, authorities claim the situation is under control, but there is a lack of credible information from the government, which makes it difficult to ascertain the true number of cases. Some of the country's Urban areas, including Shanghai, are imposing indefinite lockdown and city-wide testing following record-high outbreaks.</p>",

Although not always immediately, these areas are designated as high- or medium risk areas depending on the number of new COVID-19 cases. Such lockdowns are in principle lifted after continuous days (about a week) of no new detection of COVID-19 cases, but it is up to the discretion of local authorities.</p> <p><strong>Shanghai</strong>: Lockdown measures, including the suspension of subway services, are ongoing and authorities have yet to specify when the measures will be lifted.</p> <p>In lockdown areas, the public is reportedly not allowed to leave lockdown to procure food and other basic essentials without approval, and has to rely on authorities distributing such supplies at delivery points. Officials announced that courier services may resume in non-epidemic areas under strict health screening measures. Non-compliance or those found boycotting the lockdown measures are reportedly penalised; it was not clear what the exact penalties were.</p> <p>On 1 May, authorities allowed residents to leave home for buying essentials in \\'prevention\\' areas, including Fengxian, Jinshan, Chongming, Qingpu, Songjiang and Putuo districts, where public transport and the use of private vehicles also gradually resumed. In \\'closed\\' and \\'controlled\\' areas, including Huangpu, Jing\\'an, Xuhui, Changning, Hongkou, Yangpu, Baoshan, Minhang and Jiading 9, lockdown measures remain in effect.</p> <p>From 16 May, some businesses, including supermarkets and pharmacies, have reopened with limits on business hours and capacity; customers must obtain approval to leave lockdown and travel on pre-determined routes to visit these businesses. Also, some public areas opened and bus services resumed in the Fengxian district.</p> <p>Officials have implemented Preventive/Precautionary Zones, which allow limited movement within the designated zone. The area must not have an active case for the past two weeks to be designated as the zone. Around 7,000 localised areas have been designated under the zone. Workers of select “whitelisted” companies who tested negative for COVID-19 on a nucleic acid test were allowed to commute to work on predetermined routes.</p> <p>Local authorities impose a \\'closed-loop management\\' system, which allows some companies to resume operations, provided that all workers sleep at or near the worksite.</p> <p>The United States government ordered all non-emergency consular staff and their family members to leave Shanghai. The US Consulate in Shanghai remains operational.</p> <p><strong>Beijing</strong>: All residents and visitors on work purposes living in Beijing’s <strong>Chaoyang district</strong> have been ordered to get tested for COVID-19; authorities often periodically require mass testings across Beijing, especially in areas with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases. COVID-19 restrictions were reportedly tightened in areas east of Huanhuan, west of Xidawang Road, north of Huawei South Road and Songyu South Road, and south of Guangqu Road where residents were not allowed to leave their communities and non-essential businesses were closed. Large gatherings such as sports events and performances were suspended. Several areas in Beijing were upgraded to high- and medium-risk, including those in <strong>Chaoyang</strong>, <strong>Fangshan</strong> and <strong>Tongzhou</strong> districts. Authorities have shut down without notice more than 40 metro stations and at least 158 bus routes across Beijing, especially in the Chaoyang and Fangshan districts as part of the campaign against the spread of COVID-19. People were ordered to work from home in Chaoyang and Fangshan districts, while officials in several other areas also reportedly urged people to work remotely.</p> <p><strong>Zhengzhou</strong>, Henan province: Authorities announced that businesses were allowed to fully resume, and public transport resumed with QR code checks on the Zheng Haoban <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/%E9%83%91%E5%A5%BD%E5%8A%9E/id1502268233\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple</a> or <a href=\"https://app.diandian.com/app/n37iruo62z9vsg4/android-status\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Android</a> apps, temperature checks and a face mask mandate are in effect across non-lockdown areas.</p> <p>Authorities lifted lockdown measures in parts of Erqi, Jinshui, Guancheng and Zhongyuan districts, as well as Zhongmu county, Dengfeng and Xingyang.

Authorities did not specify whether or not the previously imposed lockdown measures in Lunan, Fengnan, Kaiping and Yutian districts were also lifted.</p> <p><strong>Langfang</strong>, Hebei province: Authorities maintained lockdown measures in the Xicheng district in <strong>Sanhe</strong>, including the Yanjiao High-tech Zone, as well as Yanjiao, Xinggong and Gaolou areas. Lockdown measures have been lifted in the east urban area, but restaurant dine-ins remained suspended, and entertainment venues remained closed to discourage traffic during the Labour Day holiday on 1 May.</p> <p>Mass testing was held across all of Langfang’s Sanhe on 3 May. Authorities lifted the lockdown in Dongcheng district on the same day following the completion of mass testing. The lockdown in the <strong>Xishi district</strong> is still in effect until further notice.</p> <p><strong>Changchun</strong>, Jilin province: Gradual lifting of lockdown measures is underway as no new COVID-19 cases have been detected. Residents cannot take public transport among other self-health monitoring measures for seven days once the lockdown is lifted from their area. Dine-in services remain suspended while mass nucleic acid testing every three days is maintained in the main urban area including the Jiutai district.</p> <p><strong>Other areas</strong></p> <p>Residents of communities within areas of designated as high- and medium-risk areas cannot leave their localities or even their residential buildings, while those in low-risk areas can leave and re-enter their areas unless told otherwise by authorities.
