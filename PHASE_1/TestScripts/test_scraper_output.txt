Meningococcal infections have been reported among young children in the country recently, the ministry said on Thursday [10 Mar 2022], urging parents and guardians to take precautions to protect their children from the disease.\r\n\r\nThe disease is caused by bacteria named _Neisseria meningitidis_ and can cause infections in the linings of the brain or the blood, or both. It has a high mortality rate if untreated, but is vaccine-preventable. The common symptoms of the disease include sudden fever, vomiting, nausea, headache, a stiff neck, backache and increased sensitivity to light.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED from HealthMap Alerts\n\n[_Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD), infects only humans; there is no animal reservoir, and the organism dies quickly outside the human host. _N. meningitidis_, which colonizes the mucosal membranes of the nose and throat, is spread person to person by sharing respiratory and throat secretions (e.g., coughing or kissing). Close and prolonged contact with an infected person or carrier facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period is 4 days but can range between 2 and 10 days.\r\n\r\nPeople at increased risk of IMD include household members and roommates of a patient with IMD, and anyone with direct contact with the patient's oral secretions, such as a boyfriend or girlfriend. These close contacts should receive antibiotics to help prevent them from getting the disease.\r\n\r\nMeningococcal meningitis occurs most frequently in the elderly, infants, and teenagers and young adults, especially if living in group settings, such as dormitories, boarding schools and military bases. Certain rare medical conditions and medications increase the risk for IMD, including complement component deficiencies, functional or anatomic asplenia, HIV/AIDS, and complement inhibitor medications, e.g., eculizumab (Soliris) and ravulizumab (Ultomiris).\r\n\r\nWe are not told in the news report above the demographic characteristics or underlying medical conditions of the patients in the outbreak of IMD in Mongolia, other than they were young children. Nor are we told the number of cases, the timeline over which the cases occurred, or the geographic distribution of the cases.\r\n\r\nMeningococci are classified into serogroups based on the antigenic specificity of their polysaccharide capsule. Although there are at least 13 _N. meningitidis_ serogroups, 6 serogroups (A, B, C, X, W, and Y) cause almost all IMD globally. Immunity following the use of a meningococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine is specific for the type of capsular polysaccharide that the vaccine contains, with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal polysaccharide groups. Some vaccines contain capsular polysaccharides (A, C, Y, W), conjugated to a protein, e.g., the MenC and the quadrivalent MenACWY vaccines. Conjugate vaccines immunize infants, reduce the carriage of meningococci in the throat and thus its transmission, as well as confer a more sustained immune response, and, therefore, longer-term protection than vaccines that contain polysaccharide alone. Serogroup B (MenB) vaccines are based upon meningococcal B protein antigens because group B capsular polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and may stimulate autoantibodies.\r\n\r\nSome countries, such as in the UK, include meningococcal vaccines in their routine childhood vaccine schedule (<https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/uk-schedule>). We are not told in the news report above if Mongolia's routine childhood vaccine schedule includes a meningococcal vaccine, the vaccine status of the infected children, or the meningococcal serogroup(s) of the outbreak strain(s).\r\n\r\nMore information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated. - Mod.ML\n\nProMED map:\nMongolia: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701950,1>]\n\n[See Also:\nMeningococcal meningitis - Europe: (Belgium) prolonged outbreak, preschool, sg B 20220304.8701800\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - USA: (MI) college student, frat party 20220129.8701149\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - UK: (England) students, sg B 20220121.8701008\r\n2021\r\n----\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - UK (02): (England) college students, RFI 20211111.8699590\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - Congo DR (03): (TO) fatal, sg W, mass vaccine 20211028.8699317\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - Congo DR (02): (TO) fatal, sg W, mass vaccine, WHO 20210921.8691501\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - Congo DR: (TO) fatal, WHO, RFI 20210909.8656884\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - New Zealand: (CA) fatal, college student 20210828.8628864\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - UK: (England) decreased incid., 1st 3m, 2021 vs 2020 20210715.8521356\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - Australia (02): (NS) sg B 20210528.8388941\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - Nigeria: (SO) susp, fatal, schoolchildren, RFI 20210326.8271578\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - Australia: (WA) RFI 20210122.8125564\r\n2020\r\n----\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - Australia (02): (SA) fatal, infant 20201109.7928745\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - Australia: (WA) sg W, Y, B 20200516.7342101\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - Costa Rica: 3rd-gen. cephalosporin resistance, RFI 20200226.7028303]\n.................................................sb/ml/rd/jh"}, 'post': '<span class="printable"><p><img src="https://promedmail.org/wp-content/plugins/promed-latest-post/assets/images/printer.gif"/><a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8701950\');"> View printable version</a> &nbsp; Share this post: <span class="addthis"><a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.promedmail.org%2Fpost%2F8701950\');"><img src="https://promedmail.org/wp-content/plugins/promed-latest-post/assets/images/share_fb.gif" class="share" /> </a></span> <span class="addthis"><a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.promedmail.org%2Fpost%2F8701950\');"><img src="https://promedmail.org/wp-content/plugins/promed-latest-post/assets/images/share_tw.gif" class="share" /> </a></span> <span class="addthis"><a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/email/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.promedmail.org%2Fpost%2F8701950\');"><img src="https://promedmail.org/wp-content/plugins/promed-latest-post/assets/images/share_em.gif" class="share" /> </a></span> </p></span><p class="publish_date_html"><span class="blue">Published Date:</span> 2022-03-13 04:14:11 AEDT <br /><span class="blue">Subject:</span> PRO/EDR> Meningitis, meningococcal - Mongolia: young children, alert, RFI <br /><span class="blue">Archive Number:</span> 20220312.8701950<div class="text1">MENINGITIS, MENINGOCOCCAL - MONGOLIA: YOUNG CHILDREN, ALERT, REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />************************************************************************************<br />A ProMED-mail post<br /><a href="http://www.promedmail.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.promedmail.org</a><br />ProMED-mail is a program of the<br />International Society for Infectious Diseases<br /><a href="http://www.isid.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.isid.org</a><br /><br />Date: Thu 10 Mar 2022 15:11 ULAT<br />Source: Bol News [edited]<br /><a href="https://www.bolnews.com/latest/2022/03/mongolia-issues-warning-over-meningococcal-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.bolnews.com/latest/2022/03/mongolia-issues-warning-over-meningococcal-disease/</a><br /><br /><br />Mongolia\'s Health Ministry declared an outbreak of the life-threatening meningococcal disease.

A similar strain has been circulating in Jordan (starting early November 2021). Their similarity has been demonstrated by their identical sequencing results which have become available on the Jordan report section in the website of the world reference laboratory for FMD, Pirbright, at <https://www.wrlfmd.org/sites/world/files/quick_media/WRLMEG-2021-00020-PAT-GTR-O-O_001.pdf>.\r\n\r\nThe genotyping results of (one) sample from the West Bank are available in a separate P.A.T. report, at <https://www.wrlfmd.org/sites/world/files/quick_media/WRLMEG-2021-00022-JOR-GTR-O-O_001.pdf>.\r\n\r\nThe said report includes also the genotyping results of a sample collected in a separate district of the P.A., namely the Gaza strip. The event there was reported to the OIE by the P.A. on 24 Dec 2021 (Archive number 20211224.8700454). Its details, as presented on the WRLFMD are: \r\nVirus sample name: 437694-0257/PAT/2021; \r\nSender reference: Gaza_437694-0257; \r\nLocation of origin: Northern part of the Gaza Strip;\r\nDate of collection: 12/2021; \r\nHost species: cattle. \r\nGenotyping results: FMDV O, topotype EA-3. This strain was found closely related to Egyptian strains (see the table titled "Most Closely Related Sequences" and the dendogram). Notably, the same topotype was reported from Gaza in February 2019 (Archive number 20190216.6320472).\r\n\r\nFMD has been reported from neighboring Israel since early February 2022. So far, 3 villages have been reportedly affected. The infected animals include dairy cattle, fattening calves and sheep. Their vaccination status is yet to be clarified.

A similar strain has been circulating in Jordan (starting early November 2021). Their similarity has been demonstrated by their identical sequencing results which have become available on the Jordan report section in the website of the world reference laboratory for FMD, Pirbright, at <a href="https://www.wrlfmd.org/sites/world/files/quick_media/WRLMEG-2021-00020-PAT-GTR-O-O_001.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.wrlfmd.org/sites/world/files/quick_media/WRLMEG-2021-00020-PAT-GTR-O-O_001.pdf</a>.<br /><br />The genotyping results of (one) sample from the West Bank are available in a separate P.A.T. report, at <a href="https://www.wrlfmd.org/sites/world/files/quick_media/WRLMEG-2021-00022-JOR-GTR-O-O_001.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.wrlfmd.org/sites/world/files/quick_media/WRLMEG-2021-00022-JOR-GTR-O-O_001.pdf</a>.<br /><br />The said report includes also the genotyping results of a sample collected in a separate district of the P.A., namely the Gaza strip. The event there was reported to the OIE by the P.A. on 24 Dec 2021 (Archive number <a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20211224.8700454\');">20211224.8700454</a>).

This strain was found closely related to Egyptian strains (see the table titled "Most Closely Related Sequences" and the dendogram). Notably, the same topotype was reported from Gaza in February 2019 (Archive number <a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20190216.6320472\');">20190216.6320472</a>).<br /><br />FMD has been reported from neighboring Israel since early February 2022.

Its host reservoir, the marsh rice rat (_Oryzomys palustris_), inhabits coastal saltmarshes of Louisiana, a region extensively impacted by anthropogenic disturbances, such as the 2010 Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill. The oil spill presents an opportunity to investigate how a large-scale ecological disturbance can influence the hantavirus host-pathogen dynamic by examining BAYV presence in its reservoir host species in areas with different oiling histories. Here, we: (1) quantify BAYV prevalence in the rice rat in coastal saltmarshes of Louisiana; (2) assess whether prevalence is driven by rice rat demographics, seasonality, or association with habitat characteristics; and (3) determine whether these factors differ by marsh oiling history. We collected mark-recapture data and blood and tissue samples over 5 years (2013-2017) at oiled, unoiled, and reference sites. Testing of the samples for BAYV revealed an antibody and RNA prevalence of 13.7%. Logistic regression analysis found that prevalence varied seasonally and interannually, and in July 2016 reached 30.8%. Sex (male) and increasing cover of _Sporobolus alterniflorus_ and open water compared to _Juncus roemerianus_ and bare ground were the strongest predictors of hantavirus prevalence. Abundance estimates derived from Huggins closed-capture models were greatest at oiled sites, but oiling treatment had no residual influence on BAYV prevalence, and abundance and prevalence were not correlated. This study supports the hypothesis that habitat is a main driver of hantavirus prevalence in the host and implies that continued and future disturbances in the region will likely impact the rice rat-BAYV dynamic by altering plant communities and landscape structure.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMahmoud Orabi\r\n<ahstandards@gmail.com>\n\n[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for submitting this report.\r\n\r\nAlthough cases of Bayou hantavirus causing human hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS) have occurred infrequently, they have been diagnosed in eastern Texas and Louisiana.

The information was released by the municipality on Tuesday [22 Feb 2022]. In December of last year [2021], the City Hall also carried out the vaccine blockade in the region of Moreeiras, for the same reason.\r\n\r\nThe cattle testing positive for rabies was located in the community of Basilio, in the district of Areado, which is about 40 km [25 mi] from the city. The mobilization, which is called anti-rabies blockade, involved domestic animals within a 5 km [3 mi] radius of the place.\r\n\r\nIn all, 326 dogs and 111 cats were vaccinated. Part of them already received the vaccine in 2021, but were revaccinated according to the guidance of the competent state bodies. The city took the opportunity to guide the population on the importance of immunizing animals and ways of transmitting and preventing the disease.\r\n\r\n"It is important to highlight that the vaccination of cattle and horses against rabies has become mandatory, on behalf of the owner of the animals, although the declaration to the Mineiro de Agropecuária Institute (IMA) is not mandatory. Anyway, this will help a lot to avoid occurrences like this", explains the director of Health Surveillance in the city, Lílian Marinho.\r\n\r\nThe professional also says the vaccination blockade of dogs and cats is a way to eliminate one of the cycles of transmission of the disease, since, if an animal was detected with rabies, it is because there are bats infected with the virus in the region and that could infect other mammals.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Patos de Minas City Hall, rabies is transmitted by bats feeding on blood, the so-called hematophagous bats. [This is likely the species more commonly known as the vampire bat. - Mod.TG]\r\n\r\nWith the virus present in saliva, it transmits the disease by sucking or licking blood from mammals, such as horses, cattle, dogs and cats. Therefore, domestic animals are the main transmission agents for humans. [If this is the vampire bat, it most likely makes a tiny razor-like cut in the skin and then licks the blood from the wound.

[Although the dog is current on its rabies vaccination, it is recommended by the rabies compendium to revaccinate immediately and then placed under a 45-day quarantine, instead of a 4-month quarantine. The compendium implies this quarantine may be a home quarantine provided certain qualifications are met. - Mod.TG] \r\n \r\nPolk County had 5 confirmed cases of rabies in 2021, and 2 in 2020.\r\n \r\nOfficials warn residents if a wild mammal is acting aggressive or appears sick to stay away and contact Animal Control immediately.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Matt Reeser]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n \r\n******\r\n[4] USA: Florida (Hillsborough County) cat, human exposure\r\nDate: Tue 8 Mar 2022\r\nSource: Bay News 9 [edited]\r\n<https://www.baynews9.com/fl/tampa/news/2022/03/08/rabies-alert-east-bank-drive-tampa>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Florida Department of Health in Hillsborough County has issued a rabies alert for the area surrounding East Bank Drive in the northeast Tampa area after a cat tested positive for rabies Monday [7 Mar 2022].\r\n\r\nThe cat was a black domestic short-haired stray cat. One person was confirmed to have been exposed and has begun rabies post-exposure vaccinations.\r\n \r\nThis rabies alert is for 60 days and includes the area bounded by Puritan Road on the north, 56th Street to the east, East Sligh Avenue to the south and the Hillsborough River to the west.\r\n\r\nThis is the 2nd rabies alert the health department issued in Hillsborough County Tuesday [8 Mar 2022].\r\n\r\nThe county also issued an alert for Glen Harwell Road in Plant City after a white and gray stray cat tested positive for rabies. Two people were confirmed exposed and have begun post-rabies vaccinations.\r\n\r\nThis alert is for 60 days as well and includes the area bordered by Interstate 4 to the north, Branch Forbes Road to the east, U.S. 92 to the south and Bethlehem Road to the west.\r\n \r\nAnyone who has been bitten, scratched or exposed to the saliva of these cats is asked to report the exposure to DOH-Hillsborough at 813-307-8059.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Health (DOH) is reminding residents to stay away from wild animals and make sure all their pets are vaccinated and do not roam free.\r\n \r\nRabies is a disease of the nervous system and is fatal to warm-blooded animals and humans. The only treatment for human exposure to rabies is rabies-specific immune globulin and rabies immunizations [Post Exposure Prophylaxis or PEP].\r\n\r\nPeople who have been bitten or scratched by wild or domestic animals should seek medical attention right away.\r\n\r\n[Byline: D\'Ann Lawrence]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[In the 1st article from Brazil, the bat in question is most likely what is commonly known as the vampire bat. It is known for feeding on cattle and a host of other animals. There are 3 species of hematophagous bats in the Neotropical region, one of which -- _Desmodus rotundus_ -- is a well-known reservoir of rabies. This species feeds on a wide range of hosts, including humans, although it will preferentially feed on large livestock such as cattle and horses. For a picture of _D. rotundus_ go to <https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/41168-Desmodus-rotundus/browse_photos>.\r\n\r\nRabies is a viral disease affecting the central nervous system of its victim, regardless of whether it is a human victim or an animal victim. This virus has no mercy and without treatment, its victim will die. \r\n\r\nWhile we recognize rabies prevention in the form of rabies vaccination for our animals, and for some high risk human beings, such as veterinarians and persons involved in animal control, it is not a wide spread practice to vaccinate human beings against rabies. Therefore, when an individual is exposed to this lethal virus, post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) must be administered. This is a series of human immunoglobulin and PEP to prevent rabies in human beings but it must be started very soon after the exposure. In the case of bats in a room where an individual was sleeping, PEP is recommended as bats can bite a sleeping individual and not awaken them.\r\n\r\nIf you have pets, including horses and other farm animals, it is the wise, prudent move to vaccinate them against rabies. It protects your pets and yourself. Even if you do not know if there has been exposure to your animal, you are more likely to be protected. - Mod.TG\n\nProMED maps:\nBrazil: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701944,6>\nCalifornia, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701944,204>\nPolk County, Florida, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701944,9743>\nHillsborough County, Florida, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701944,4562>]\n\n[See Also:\nRabies (07): Americas (Canada, USA) fox, dog, bat, cat, human exp 20220223.8701603\r\nRabies (05): Americas (Brazil,USA) bat, fox, pets, horse, human exp 20220211.8701394\r\nRabies (04): Americas (Canada) ex Iran, dog, human exp, OIE 20220209.8701369\r\nRabies (03): Americas (USA, Canada) animals, human exp 20220205.8701273\r\nRabies (02): Americas (USA) human deaths, 2021 20220108.8700733\r\nRabies (01): Americas (Brazil, Canada, USA) animal, human exp 20220101.8700617\r\n2021\r\n----\r\nRabies (43): Americas (Canada, USA) animals, human exp 20211225.8700467\r\nRabies (42): Americas (Brazil, Canada, USA) human death, animal exp 20211127.8699909\r\nRabies (41): Americas (USA) imported dogs, rule change 20211126.8699900\r\nRabies (39): Americas (USA, Canada) animal, human 20211106.8699482\r\nRabies (36): Americas (USA) animal, human 20210930.8698792\r\nRabies (34): Americas (USA) various animals, human exp 20210912.8663860\r\nRabies (30): Americas (USA) raccoon, cat, dog, fox, human exp 20210814.8595520\r\nRabies (20): Americas (USA) imported dog 20210630.8487313\r\nRabies (11): Americas (USA) bat, human exp 20210519.8370609\r\nRabies (09): Americas (Canada, USA) wild and domestic animals, exposure 20210504.8342817\r\nRabies (03): Americas (USA) raccoon, dog, bobcat, fox, human exp 20210123.8128938\r\nRabies (02): Americas (USA, Canada) otter, fox, human exp 20210103.8066208\r\nRabies (01): Americas (USA) raccoon, dog, cat, human exp 20210102.8064117\r\n2020\r\n----\r\nRabies (33): Americas (USA) cow, skunk, cat, raccoon, human exp 20201205.7996307\r\nRabies (30): Americas (USA) coyote, bat, imported dog ex Egypt, human exp 20201108.7925072\r\nRabies (29): Americas (USA) animal, human exposure 20201101.7908381\r\nRabies (28): Americas (USA) animal, human exp 20201018.7871698\r\nRabies (27): Americas (USA) animal, human exp 20201003.7829604\r\nRabies (26): Americas (USA) bat, human exp 20200928.7818946\r\nRabies (25): Americas (USA) animal, human exp 20200904.7745166\r\nRabies (23): Americas (USA) bat 20200731.7632899\r\nRabies (10): Americas (USA) raccoon, dog, bull, human exp 20200412.7213951\r\nRabies (08): Americas (USA, Canada) cat, dog, fox, skunk, human exp 20200321.7122312\r\nRabies (06): Americas (USA) cat, fox, cow, human exp 20200302.7041402\r\nRabies (03): Americas (USA) cat, fox, otter, coyote, human exposure 20200214.6987679\r\nRabies (02): Americas (USA) raccoon, cat, human, dog exp 20200201.6943518\r\n2019\r\n----\r\nRabies (57): Americas (USA) raccoon, cat, human exp 20191226.6858881\r\nRabies (53): Americas (USA) fox, human exp 20191125.6797040\r\nRabies (50): Americas (USA) cat, dog, human exposure 20191110.6771632\r\nRabies (40): Americas (USA) bat, human exp 20190730.6595948\r\nRabies (30): Americas, USA (FL, NC) cat, fox, dog, human exposure 20190526.6488419\r\nRabies (28): Americas, USA, cattle, imported dogs, corr. 20190512.6466342]\n.................................................sb/tg/may/jh'}, 'post': '<span class="printable"><p><img src="https://promedmail.org/wp-content/plugins/promed-latest-post/assets/images/printer.gif"/><a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8701944\');"> View printable version</a> &nbsp;

Humans can be exposed if they\'re bitten, or if the saliva otherwise enters a break in a person\'s skin, according to the California Department of Public Health.<br /> <br />A rabies vaccine is available, but if it is not administered in time, "there is no effective treatment, and the infected person will likely die within a few days," CDPH said.<br /> <br />Anyone with concerns about exposure risks was encouraged to contact the county health department at 951-358-5107.<br /><br />--<br />Communicated by:<br />ProMED HealthMap Alerts<br /><br />******<br />[3] USA: Florida (Polk County) bat, dog<br />Date: Thu 3 Mar 2022<br />Source: WFTV <br /><a href="https://bit.ly/3KBFQaq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bit.ly/3KBFQaq</a><br /><br /><br />Animal Control officials have confirmed the 1st case of rabies this year [2022] in Polk County.<br /> <br />Officials said a bat had tested positive for the deadly virus on [3 Mar 2022].<br /> <br />According to the Polk County Sheriff\'s Office Animal Control Section, a family dog in the Lake Mirror area of Winter Haven was found with a live bat in its mouth on [1 Mar 2022].<br /> <br />The family contacted Animal Control which then sent the bat to a Tampa lab for testing.<br /><br />Officials say the dog was current on its rabies vaccination, but will still need to be quarantined to make sure it is not infected. [Although the dog is current on its rabies vaccination, it is recommended by the rabies compendium to revaccinate immediately and then placed under a 45-day quarantine, instead of a 4-month quarantine.

The only treatment for human exposure to rabies is rabies-specific immune globulin and rabies immunizations [Post Exposure Prophylaxis or PEP].<br /><br />People who have been bitten or scratched by wild or domestic animals should seek medical attention right away.<br /><br />[Byline: D\'Ann Lawrence]<br /><br />--<br />Communicated by:<br />ProMED<br /><br />[In the 1st article from Brazil, the bat in question is most likely what is commonly known as the vampire bat. It is known for feeding on cattle and a host of other animals. There are 3 species of hematophagous bats in the Neotropical region, one of which -- _Desmodus rotundus_ -- is a well-known reservoir of rabies. This species feeds on a wide range of hosts, including humans, although it will preferentially feed on large livestock such as cattle and horses. For a picture of _D. rotundus_ go to <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/41168-Desmodus-rotundus/browse_photos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/41168-Desmodus-rotundus/browse_photos</a>.<br /><br />Rabies is a viral disease affecting the central nervous system of its victim, regardless of whether it is a human victim or an animal victim. This virus has no mercy and without treatment, its victim will die. <br /><br />While we recognize rabies prevention in the form of rabies vaccination for our animals, and for some high risk human beings, such as veterinarians and persons involved in animal control, it is not a wide spread practice to vaccinate human beings against rabies. Therefore, when an individual is exposed to this lethal virus, post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) must be administered. This is a series of human immunoglobulin and PEP to prevent rabies in human beings but it must be started very soon after the exposure. In the case of bats in a room where an individual was sleeping, PEP is recommended as bats can bite a sleeping individual and not awaken them.<br /><br />If you have pets, including horses and other farm animals, it is the wise, prudent move to vaccinate them against rabies. It protects your pets and yourself. Even if you do not know if there has been exposure to your animal, you are more likely to be protected. - Mod.TG<br /><br />ProMED maps:<br />Brazil: <a

Deaths also fell, declining by 8%.\r\n\r\nMore than 10 million cases were reported to the WHO last week, with South Korea, Germany, Viet Nam, Russia, and Japan reporting the most. There were more than 52 000 new deaths, and the United States continues to report the most COVID-19 fatalities of any country.\r\n\r\nIn the WHO\'s Western Pacific region, rising cases were driven by surges in South Korea, Hong Kong, Viet Nam, and New Zealand. South Korea today [9 Mar 2022] reported a new record high, with 342 466 new cases, as did Hong Kong, with 58 757 new cases. Elsewhere, China\'s cases reached a new 2-year high, with 555 new cases, and health officials in Shanghai are battling an uptick in asymptomatic cases by doing mass testing, delaying some large gatherings and shutting some public spaces, according to Reuters (<https://news.yahoo.com/shanghai-steps-defences-against-wave-070017082.html>).\r\n\r\nOf sequenced samples over the past month, 99.7% were the omicron variant, and, of those, 34.2% were the more transmissible BA.2 omicron subvariant. The WHO said its technical advisory group is aware of reports of recombinants of delta and omicron and of BA.1 and BA.2, which it said isn\'t surprising.\r\n\r\nSo far, however, sequencing hasn\'t identified any signs of rapid transmission or changes in illness severity. And only a few recombinant clusters have been reported, with little sign of spread.\r\n\r\nAt a briefing today [9 Mar 2022], WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said though cases and deaths are declining and countries are loosening restrictions, the pandemic is far from over. "The virus continues to evolve, and we continue to face major obstacles in distributing vaccines, tests, and treatments everywhere they are needed," he said (<https://bit.ly/3i2uvUw>).\r\n\r\nTedros also said the WHO is concerned that several countries have drastically reduced testing, which he says clouds the ability to see where the virus is, how it\'s spreading, and how it\'s evolving.\r\n\r\nIn a related development today [9 Mar 2022], the WHO posted interim guidance on the use of rapid tests, which it says should be offered as part of overall COVID-19 testing services. The guidance addresses implementation considerations, including prioritizing populations, test accessibility, and reporting (<https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Ag-RDTs-Self_testing-2022.1>).\r\n\r\n[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\r\n\r\n----\r\n[B] Hawaii: mask mandate\r\nDate: Wed 9 Mar 2022\r\nSource: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [abridged, edited]\r\n<https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/global-drop-covid-19-continues-cases-still-high>\r\n\r\n\r\nYesterday [8 Mar 2022] Hawaii became the final US state to announce that indoor mask requirements related to the COVID-19 pandemic will end; the step takes effect on 26 Mar 2022. Puerto Rico announced earlier this week that all mask mandates on the island would be ending this week [10 Mar 2022].\r\n\r\nNew cases of COVID-19 continue to drop across the country. The United States reported 29 805 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [8 Mar 2022] and 1532 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker (<https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases>). The 7-day average of new daily cases is 38 239, with 1398 daily deaths, according to the Washington Post tracker (<https://wapo.st/3w3Z0l5>). In total, the country has seen 79 385 516 COVID-19 cases in the past 2 years, including 963 079 deaths.\r\n\r\nWidespread infection with the omicron variant and vaccination has helped raised immunity in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID Data Tracker shows 65.1% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 76.6% have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 44.1% of fully vaccinated Americans have received a booster dose (<https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total>).\r\n\r\nAs the country moves on to the next phase of the pandemic, both the White House and public health experts are touting a test-to-treat program that pairs positive COVID-19 tests with antiviral drugs. Pfizer today [9 Mar 2022] launched a phase 2/3 study of its approved antiviral, Paxlovid, in kids ages 6-17.\r\n\r\n"There is a significant unmet need for outpatient treatments that can be taken by children and adolescents to help prevent progression to severe illness, including hospitalization or death," said Mikael Dolsten, chief scientific officer and president of worldwide research, development and medical at Pfizer in a press release (<https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-initiates-phase-23-study-novel-covid-19-oral>).\r\n\r\n"Paxlovid is already authorized or approved in many countries around the world, with more than 1.5 million treatment courses delivered thus far and 30 million expected by July [2022] to help combat this devastating disease."\r\n\r\n[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n\r\n******\r\n[2] USA: deaths\r\nDate: Tue 8 Mar 2022 16:03 EST\r\nSource: The Atlantic [abridged, edited]\r\n<https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/03/covid-us-death-rate/626972/>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe United States reported more deaths from COVID-19 last Friday [4 Mar 2022] than deaths from Hurricane Katrina, more on any 2 recent weekdays than deaths during the 9/11 terrorist attacks, more last month [February 2022] than deaths from flu in a bad season, and more in 2 years than deaths from HIV during the 4 decades of the AIDS epidemic. At least 953 000 Americans have died from COVID, and the true toll is likely even higher because many deaths went uncounted. COVID is now the 3rd leading cause of death in the United States, after only heart disease and cancer, which are both catchall terms for many distinct diseases. The sheer scale of the tragedy strains the moral imagination. On 24 May 2020, as the United States passed 100 000 recorded deaths, The New York Times filled its front page with the names of the dead, describing their loss as "incalculable." Now the nation hurtles toward a milestone of one million. What is 10 times incalculable?\r\n\r\nMany countries have been pummeled by the coronavirus, but few have fared as poorly as the United States. Its death rate surpassed that of any other large, wealthy nation -- especially during the recent omicron surge. The Biden administration placed all its bets on a vaccine-focused strategy, rather than the multilayered protections that many experts called for, even as America lagged behind other wealthy countries in vaccinating (and boosting) its citizens -- especially elderly people, who are most vulnerable to the virus. In a study of 29 high-income countries, the United States experienced the largest decline in life expectancy in 2020 and, unlike much of Europe, did not bounce back in 2021. It was also the only country whose lowered life span was driven mainly by deaths among people under 60. Dying from COVID robbed each American of about a decade of life on average. As a whole, US life expectancy fell by 2 years -- the largest such decline in almost a century. Neither World War II nor any of the flu pandemics that followed it dented American longevity so badly.\r\n\r\nEvery American who died of COVID left an average of 9 close relatives bereaved. Roughly 9 million people -- 3% of the population -- now have a permanent hole in their world that was once filled by a parent, child, sibling, spouse, or grandparent. An estimated 149 000 children have lost a parent or caregiver. Many people were denied the familiar rituals of mourning -- bedside goodbyes, in-person funerals. Others are grieving raw and recent losses, their grief trampled amid the stampede toward normal.\r\n\r\nAfter many of the biggest disasters in American memory, including 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, "it felt like the world stopped," Lori Peek, a sociologist at the University of Colorado at Boulder who studies disasters, told me. "On some level, we owned our failures, and there were real changes." Crossing one million deaths could offer a similar opportunity to take stock, but "900 000 deaths felt like a big threshold to me, and we didn\'t pause," Peek said. Why is that? Why were so many publications and politicians focused on reopenings in January and February [2022] -- the 4th- and 5th-deadliest months of the pandemic? Why did the CDC issue new guidelines that allowed most Americans to dispense with indoor masking when at least 1000 people had been dying of COVID every day for almost 6 straight months? If the United States faced half a year of daily hurricanes that each took 1000 lives, it is hard to imagine that the nation would decide to, quite literally, throw caution to the wind. Why, then, is COVID different?\r\n\r\nMany aspects of the pandemic work against a social reckoning. The threat -- a virus -- is invisible, and the damage it inflicts is hidden from public view. With no lapping floodwaters or smoking buildings, the tragedy becomes contestable to a degree that a natural disaster or terrorist attack cannot be. Meanwhile, many of those who witnessed COVID\'s ruin are in no position to discuss it. Healthcare workers are still reeling from "death on a scale I had never seen before," as an intensive-care nurse told me last year [2021]. The bereaved face guilt on top of sadness: "I think about the way it would run through families and tight-knit groups and the huge psychological toll as people think, Am I the one who brought it in?" Whitney Robinson, a social epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told me. And though 3% of Americans have lost a close family member to COVID, that means 97% have not. The 2 years that were shaved off of the average life span undid 2 decades of progress in health, but in 2000, "it didn\'t feel like we were living under a horrible mortality regime," Andrew Noymer, a demographer at UC Irvine, told me. "It felt normal."\r\n\r\nNo one knows how many people will die from COVID in the coming years. The number will depend on our collective behavior, how many more people can be vaccinated or boosted, the length and strength of immunity, what new variants arise, and more. Andrew Noymer, the demographer, thinks that COVID will kill fewer people per year than it has in the past 2, but will probably still be more lethal than the flu, which sets a plausible and very wide range of somewhere between 50 000 and 500 000 annual deaths. (COVID will also continue to cause long-term disability.)\r\n\r\nHow much of this extra mortality will the United States accept? The CDC\'s new guidelines provide a clue. They recommend that protective measures such as indoor masking kick in once communities pass certain thresholds of cases and hospitalizations. But the health-policy experts Joshua Salomon and Alyssa Bilinski calculated that by the time communities hit the CDC\'s thresholds, they\'d be on the path to at least 3 daily deaths per million, which equates to 1000 deaths per day nationally. And crucially, the warning lights would go off too late to prevent those deaths. "As a level of mortality the White House and CDC are willing to accept before calling for more public health protection, this is heartbreaking," Salomon said on Twitter.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Ed Yong]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nClaudinne Miller\r\nTulane Outbreak News\r\n<cmiller15@tulane.edu>\r\n\r\n[An interesting perspective on the public\'s reaction to COVID case counts and deaths worth reading in full. - Mod.LK]\r\n\r\n******\r\n[3] CIDRAP News\r\n[A] UK: BA.2\r\nDate: Thu 10 Mar 2022\r\nSource: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [abridged, edited]\r\n<https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/covid-19-remains-high-uk-ba2-gains-ground>\r\n\r\n\r\nAn ongoing swab testing study that\'s been underway for the last 2 years to monitor COVID-19 spread in the United Kingdom revealed that, although cases are declining, they remain at a high level, with signs of a potential increase in older age-groups. The UK REACT study, done by a research team based at Imperial College London, has been tracking disease levels with swab tests.\r\n\r\nPublic health officials have urged countries to continue population monitoring for COVID-19 to assess who is getting infected and where the virus is spreading. Also, health officials closely watch patterns in Britain and other European countries because their COVID-19 trends have been a harbinger of how outbreaks could unfold elsewhere, including in the United States.\r\n\r\nFor the latest study, the group analyzed the results of nearly 95 000 swab tests that were conducted across the country from 8 Feb to 1 Mar 2022 (<https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/95323/2/REACT_R18_and_SI.pdf>). Since the last report that covered roughly January [2022], prevalence of COVID-19 dropped from 4.41% to 2.88%. The researchers noted, however, that, at 2.88%, prevalence is still high -- at the 2nd-highest level since the study began in March 2020.\r\n\r\nTheir analysis of genetic sequences from 1195 samples showed that all but one was the omicron variant, and, as of 21 Feb 2022, they estimate that nearly half (47.2%) were the BA.2 subvariant, which is more transmissible than the parent omicron virus. In their last report, released in late January [2022], they found that only 6 sequences were BA.2 (<https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/233381/fall-coronavirus-infections-england-have-stalled/>).\r\n\r\nInfection rates varied by age and region, and the team noted that levels were flat or possibly rising in people ages 55 and older. Also, the team saw high infection rates in London, followed by the southwest.\r\n\r\nJenny Harries, MD, chief executive of the UK\'s Health Security Agency, said in a statement that the data confirm that cases have declined since the omicron peak. "However, the increasing presence of the BA.2 sub-lineage of omicron and the recent slight increase in infections in those over 55 shows that the pandemic is not over and that we can expect to see COVID-19 circulating at high levels."\r\n\r\nPaul Elliott, MBBS, PhD, who directs the REACT program at Imperial College London, said the possibility that infections are rising in older adults indicates that a high number of infections will lead to more illnesses, even though the group is highly vaccinated. "So it\'s important that people continue to follow public health guidance to avoid fueling further spread of the virus."\r\n\r\nSurges continue in omicron hot spots: Hong Kong leaders appear to be stepping back from mass testing as part of handling its surge of cases, with more than 31 402 cases and 180 deaths reported today [10 Mar 2022]. Chief Executive Carrie Lam today said Hong Kong won\'t lift its ban on flights from 9 countries and reopen the city until its surge is under control, according to Reuters (<https://reut.rs/3t2mNjl>).\r\n\r\nChina\'s rise in COVID-19 activity continues, with 402 more local symptomatic cases reported as well as 435 more local asymptomatic infections, according to the National Health Commission. The largest portion were from Jilin province, which had 165 of the symptomatic cases and 179 of the asymptomatic cases (<http://en.nhc.gov.cn/2022-03/10/c_85882.htm>).\r\n\r\nIn Germany, cases topped 250 000 for the 1st time during the pandemic, according to Deutsche Welle, which said the coalition government has settled on new COVID measures to replace ones that expire on 19 Mar 2022. The new ones include basic steps such as masking on public transport and limiting regular testing to nursing homes and other vulnerable settings, though states can institute other measures if they experience future spikes (<https://www.dw.com/en/germany-new-daily-covid-19-infections-pass-250000-for-first-time/a-61075687>).\r\n\r\nNew Zealand, which is experiencing its worst surge, is feeling COVID-19 pressure on doctor\'s offices and hospitals, according to Radio New Zealand, which said general practice clinic workload has increased 50% and patient loads at Auckland hospitals are already above their worst-case scenarios (<https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/463054/watch-live-covid-19-briefing-it-is-still-going-to-be-messy-for-the-next-couple-of-weeks>).\r\n\r\n[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n\r\n----\r\n[B] USA: coronavirus package\r\nDate: Thu 10 Mar 2022\r\nSource: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [abridged, edited]\r\n<https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/covid-19-remains-high-uk-ba2-gains-ground>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives failed to include a USD 15 billion coronavirus pandemic package when it approved a USD 1.5 trillion spending bill yesterday [9 Mar 2022], signaling a major setback for the Biden administration. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said a separate COVID relief bill will be introduced, The Hill reports (<https://thehill.com/homenews/house/597589-pelosi-says-separate-coronavirus-relief-bill-will-be-put-on-the-floor>).\r\n\r\nFor weeks the administration has petitioned lawmakers to increase funding for pandemic-related relief packages, but the war in Ukraine and plummeting case counts have pushed the pandemic to the political back burner. The 7-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases is 37 685, with 1369 daily deaths, according to The New York Times tracker (<https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html>).\r\n\r\nIn related news, a new poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) shows that 40% to 60% of Americans missed work during the omicron surge, and 6 of 10 Americans who earn USD 40 000 or less a year reported missing work owing to the most recent surge of the virus. Twenty percent of those polled said missing work had a significant impact on family finances.\r\n\r\nAs the nation enters the 3rd year of the pandemic, many companies continue to change pandemic policies. United Airlines, one of the 1st major companies to announce vaccine mandates last summer [2021], announced it will allow workers who haven\'t been vaccinated against COVID-19 for religious or medical reasons to return at the end of the month [March 2022], the Wall Street Journal reports (<https://on.wsj.com/3tSo6AC>).\r\n\r\n[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n\r\n******\r\n[4] WHO: daily new cases reported (as of 10 Mar 2022)\r\nDate: Thu 10 Mar 2022\r\nSource: WHO [abridged, edited]\r\n<https://covid19.who.int/table>\r\n\r\n\r\n*Daily case reports as of 10 Mar 2022 16:48 CET\r\n\r\nSurveillance\r\n------------\r\nWHO region (no. countries/territories):\r\nTotal confirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nWestern Pacific Region (19): 30 049 923 (789 738) / 190 747 (1091)\r\nEuropean Region (61): 185 513 805 (800 258) / 1 897 675 (2392)\r\nSouth-East Asia Region (10): 56 335 465 (48 894) / 767 622 (456)\r\nEastern Mediterranean Region (22): 21 375 560 (12 670) / 337 612 (255)\r\nRegion of the Americas (54): 148 475 359 (147 136) / 2 654 909 (2865)\r\nAfrican Region (49): 8 478 759 (18 229) / 170 507 (104)\r\nCases on an international conveyance: 764 (0) / 13 (0)\r\n\r\nConfirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)\r\nGrand total: 450 229 635 (1 816 925) / 6 019 085 (7163)\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n[Data by country, area, or territory for 10 Mar 2022 can be accessed at <https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20WHO%20Data%20Tables%20MAR10_1647026659.pdf>.\r\n\r\n- The Americas region reported 8.0% of cases and 39.9% of deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported more than 148.47 million cases, 2nd to the European region as the most severely affected region.

a row, but hotspots remain in a handful of countries, especially in Asia, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in its latest weekly update.<br /><br />Cases declined 5% last week compared to the week before, marking a smaller decline compared with earlier weeks over the past month. Deaths also fell, declining by 8%.<br /><br />More than 10 million cases were reported to the WHO last week, with South Korea, Germany, Viet Nam, Russia, and Japan reporting the most. There were more than 52 000 new deaths, and the United States continues to report the most COVID-19 fatalities of any country.<br /><br />In the WHO\'s Western Pacific region, rising cases were driven by surges in South Korea, Hong Kong, Viet Nam, and New Zealand. South Korea today [9 Mar 2022] reported a new record high, with 342 466 new cases, as did Hong Kong, with 58 757 new cases. Elsewhere, China\'s cases reached a new 2-year high, with 555 new cases, and health officials in Shanghai are battling an uptick in asymptomatic cases by doing mass testing, delaying some large gatherings and shutting some public spaces, according to Reuters (<a href="https://news.yahoo.com/shanghai-steps-defences-against-wave-070017082.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://news.yahoo.com/shanghai-steps-defences-against-wave-070017082.html</a>).<br /><br />Of sequenced samples over the past month, 99.7% were the omicron variant, and, of those, 34.2% were the more transmissible BA.2 omicron subvariant. The WHO said its technical advisory group is aware of reports of recombinants of delta and omicron and of BA.1 and BA.2, which it said isn\'t surprising.<br /><br />So far, however, sequencing hasn\'t identified any signs of rapid transmission or changes in illness severity. And only a few recombinant clusters have been reported, with little sign of spread.<br /><br />At a briefing today [9 Mar 2022], WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said though cases and deaths are declining and countries are loosening restrictions, the pandemic is far from over. "The virus continues to evolve, and we continue to face major obstacles in distributing vaccines, tests, and treatments everywhere they are needed," he said (<a href="https://bit.ly/3i2uvUw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bit.ly/3i2uvUw</a>).<br /><br />Tedros also said the WHO is concerned that several countries have drastically reduced testing, which he says clouds the ability to see where the virus is, how it\'s spreading, and how it\'s evolving.<br /><br />In a related development today [9 Mar 2022], the WHO posted interim guidance on the use of rapid tests, which it says should be offered as part of overall COVID-19 testing services. The guidance addresses implementation considerations, including prioritizing populations, test accessibility, and reporting (<a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Ag-RDTs-Self_testing-2022.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Ag-RDTs-Self_testing-2022.1</a>).<br /><br />[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]<br /><br />--<br />Communicated by:<br />Mary Marshall<br />&lt;mjm2020@googlemail.com><br /><br />----<br />[B] Hawaii: mask mandate<br />Date: Wed 9 Mar 2022<br />Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [abridged, edited]<br /><a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/global-drop-covid-19-continues-cases-still-high" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/global-drop-covid-19-continues-cases-still-high</a><br /><br /><br />Yesterday [8 Mar 2022] Hawaii became the final US state to announce that indoor mask requirements related to the COVID-19 pandemic will end; the step takes effect on 26 Mar 2022. Puerto Rico announced earlier this week that all mask mandates on the island would be ending this week [10 Mar 2022].<br /><br />New cases of COVID-19 continue to drop across the country. The United States reported 29 805 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [8 Mar 2022] and 1532 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker (<a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases</a>). The 7-day average of new daily cases is 38 239, with 1398 daily deaths, according to the Washington Post tracker (<a href="https://wapo.st/3w3Z0l5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://wapo.st/3w3Z0l5</a>). In total, the country has seen 79 385 516 COVID-19 cases in the past 2 years, including 963 079 deaths.<br /><br />Widespread infection with the omicron variant and vaccination has helped raised immunity in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID Data Tracker shows 65.1% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 76.6% have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 44.1% of fully vaccinated Americans have received a booster dose (<a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total</a>).<br /><br />As the country moves on to the next phase of the pandemic, both the White House and public health experts are touting a test-to-treat program that pairs positive COVID-19 tests with antiviral drugs. Pfizer today [9 Mar 2022] launched a phase 2/3 study of its approved antiviral, Paxlovid, in kids ages 6-17.<br /><br />"There is a significant unmet need for outpatient treatments that can be taken by children and adolescents to help prevent progression to severe illness, including hospitalization or death," said Mikael Dolsten, chief scientific officer and president of worldwide research, development and medical at Pfizer in a press release (<a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-initiates-phase-23-study-novel-covid-19-oral" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-initiates-phase-23-study-novel-covid-19-oral</a>).<br /><br />"Paxlovid is already authorized or approved in many countries around the world, with more than 1.5 million treatment courses delivered thus far and 30 million expected by July [2022] to help combat this devastating disease."<br /><br />[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]<br /><br />--<br />Communicated by:<br />Mary Marshall<br /><br />******<br />[2] USA: deaths<br />Date: Tue 8 Mar 2022 16:03 EST<br />Source: The Atlantic [abridged, edited]<br /><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/03/covid-us-death-rate/626972/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/03/covid-us-death-rate/626972/</a><br /><br /><br />The United States reported more deaths from COVID-19 last Friday [4 Mar 2022] than deaths from Hurricane Katrina, more on any 2 recent weekdays than deaths during the 9/11 terrorist attacks, more last month [February 2022] than deaths from flu in a bad season, and more in 2 years than deaths from HIV during the 4 decades of the AIDS epidemic. At least 953 000 Americans have died from COVID, and the true toll is likely even higher because many deaths went uncounted. COVID is now the 3rd leading cause of death in the United States, after only heart disease and cancer, which are both catchall terms for many distinct diseases. The sheer scale of the tragedy strains the moral imagination. On 24 May 2020, as the United States passed 100 000 recorded deaths, The New York Times filled its front page with the names of the dead, describing their loss as "incalculable." Now the nation hurtles toward a milestone of one million. What is 10 times incalculable?<br /><br />Many countries have been pummeled by the coronavirus, but few have fared as poorly as the United States. Its death rate surpassed that of any other large, wealthy nation -- especially during the recent omicron surge. The Biden administration placed all its bets on a vaccine-focused strategy, rather than the multilayered protections that many experts called for, even as America lagged behind other wealthy countries in vaccinating (and boosting) its citizens -- especially elderly people, who are most vulnerable to the virus. In a study of 29 high-income countries, the United States experienced the largest decline in life expectancy in 2020 and, unlike much of Europe, did not bounce back in 2021. It was also the only country whose lowered life span was driven mainly by deaths among people under 60. Dying from COVID robbed each American of about a decade of life on average. As a whole, US life expectancy fell by 2 years -- the largest such decline in almost a century. Neither World War II nor any of the flu pandemics that followed it dented American longevity so badly.<br /><br />Every American who died of COVID left an average of 9 close relatives bereaved. Roughly 9 million people -- 3% of the population -- now have a permanent hole in their world that was once filled by a parent, child, sibling, spouse, or grandparent. An estimated 149 000 children have lost a parent or caregiver. Many people were denied the familiar rituals of mourning -- bedside goodbyes, in-person funerals. Others are grieving raw and recent losses, their grief trampled amid the stampede toward normal.<br /><br />After many of the biggest disasters in American memory, including 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, "it felt like the world stopped," Lori Peek, a sociologist at the University of Colorado at Boulder who studies disasters, told me. "On some level, we owned our failures, and there were real changes." Crossing one million deaths could offer a similar opportunity to take stock, but "900 000 deaths felt like a big threshold to me, and we didn\'t pause," Peek said. Why is that? Why were so many publications and politicians focused on reopenings in January and February [2022] -- the 4th- and 5th-deadliest months of the pandemic? Why did the CDC issue new guidelines that allowed most Americans to dispense with indoor masking when at least 1000 people had been dying of COVID every day for almost 6 straight months? If the United States faced half a year of daily hurricanes that each took 1000 lives, it is hard to imagine that the nation would decide to, quite literally, throw caution to the wind. Why, then, is COVID different?<br /><br />Many aspects of the pandemic work against a social reckoning. The threat -- a virus -- is invisible, and the damage it inflicts is hidden from public view. With no lapping floodwaters or smoking buildings, the tragedy becomes contestable to a degree that a natural disaster or terrorist attack cannot be. Meanwhile, many of those who witnessed COVID\'s ruin are in no position to discuss it. Healthcare workers are still reeling from "death on a scale I had never seen before," as an intensive-care nurse told me last year [2021]. The bereaved face guilt on top of sadness: "I think about the way it would run through families and tight-knit groups and the huge psychological toll as people think, Am I the one who brought it in?" Whitney Robinson, a social epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told me. And though 3% of Americans have lost a close family member to COVID, that means 97% have not. The 2 years that were shaved off of the average life span undid 2 decades of progress in health, but in 2000, "it didn\'t feel like we were living under a horrible mortality regime," Andrew Noymer, a demographer at UC Irvine, told me. "It felt normal."<br /><br />No one knows how many people will die from COVID in the coming years. The number will depend on our collective behavior, how many more people can be vaccinated or boosted, the length and strength of immunity, what new variants arise, and more. Andrew Noymer, the demographer, thinks that COVID will kill fewer people per year than it has in the past 2, but will probably still be more lethal than the flu, which sets a plausible and very wide range of somewhere between 50 000 and 500 000 annual deaths. (COVID will also continue to cause long-term disability.)<br /><br />How much of this extra mortality will the United States accept? The CDC\'s new guidelines provide a clue. They recommend that protective measures such as indoor masking kick in once communities pass certain thresholds of cases and hospitalizations. But the health-policy experts Joshua Salomon and Alyssa Bilinski calculated that by the time communities hit the CDC\'s thresholds, they\'d be on the path to at least 3 daily deaths per million, which equates to 1000 deaths per day nationally. And crucially, the warning lights would go off too late to prevent those deaths. "As a level of mortality the White House and CDC are willing to accept before calling for more public health protection, this is heartbreaking," Salomon said on Twitter.<br /><br />[Byline: Ed Yong]<br /><br />--<br />Communicated by:<br />Claudinne Miller<br />Tulane Outbreak News<br />&lt;cmiller15@tulane.edu><br /><br />[An interesting perspective on the public\'s reaction to COVID case counts and deaths worth reading in full. - Mod.LK]<br /><br />******<br />[3] CIDRAP News<br />[A] UK: BA.2<br />Date: Thu 10 Mar 2022<br />Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [abridged, edited]<br /><a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/covid-19-remains-high-uk-ba2-gains-ground" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/covid-19-remains-high-uk-ba2-gains-ground</a><br /><br /><br />An ongoing swab testing study that\'s been underway for the last 2 years to monitor COVID-19 spread in the United Kingdom revealed that, although cases are declining, they remain at a high level, with signs of a potential increase in older age-groups. The UK REACT study, done by a research team based at Imperial College London, has been tracking disease levels with swab tests.<br /><br />Public health officials have urged countries to continue population monitoring for COVID-19 to assess who is getting infected and where the virus is spreading. Also, health officials closely watch patterns in Britain and other European countries because their COVID-19 trends have been a harbinger of how outbreaks could unfold elsewhere, including in the United States.<br /><br />For the latest study, the group analyzed the results of nearly 95 000 swab tests that were conducted across the country from 8 Feb to 1 Mar 2022 (<a href="https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/95323/2/REACT_R18_and_SI.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/95323/2/REACT_R18_and_SI.pdf</a>). Since the last report that covered roughly January [2022], prevalence of COVID-19 dropped from 4.41% to 2.88%. The researchers noted, however, that, at 2.88%, prevalence is still high -- at the 2nd-highest level since the study began in March 2020.<br /><br />Their analysis of genetic sequences from 1195 samples showed that all but one was the omicron variant, and, as of 21 Feb 2022, they estimate that nearly half (47.2%) were the BA.2 subvariant, which is more transmissible than the parent omicron virus. In their last report, released in late January [2022], they found that only 6 sequences were BA.2 (<a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/233381/fall-coronavirus-infections-england-have-stalled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/233381/fall-coronavirus-infections-england-have-stalled/</a>).<br /><br />Infection rates varied by age and region, and the team noted that levels were flat or possibly rising in people ages 55 and older. Also, the team saw high infection rates in London, followed by the southwest.<br /><br />Jenny Harries, MD, chief executive of the UK\'s Health Security Agency, said in a statement that the data confirm that cases have declined since the omicron peak. "However, the increasing presence of the BA.2 sub-lineage of omicron and the recent slight increase in infections in those over 55 shows that the pandemic is not over and that we can expect to see COVID-19 circulating at high levels."<br /><br />Paul Elliott, MBBS, PhD, who directs the REACT program at Imperial College London, said the possibility that infections are rising in older adults indicates that a high number of infections will lead to more illnesses, even though the group is highly vaccinated. "So it\'s important that people continue to follow public health guidance to avoid fueling further spread of the virus."<br /><br />Surges continue in omicron hot spots: Hong Kong leaders appear to be stepping back from mass testing as part of handling its surge of cases, with more than 31 402 cases and 180 deaths reported today [10 Mar 2022]. Chief Executive Carrie Lam today said Hong Kong won\'t lift its ban on flights from 9 countries and reopen the city until its surge is under control, according to Reuters (<a href="https://reut.rs/3t2mNjl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://reut.rs/3t2mNjl</a>).<br /><br />China\'s rise in COVID-19 activity continues, with 402 more local symptomatic cases reported as well as 435 more local asymptomatic infections, according to the National Health Commission. The largest portion were from Jilin province, which had 165 of the symptomatic cases and 179 of the asymptomatic cases (<a href="http://en.nhc.gov.cn/2022-03/10/c_85882.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://en.nhc.gov.cn/2022-03/10/c_85882.htm</a>).<br /><br />In Germany, cases topped 250 000 for the 1st time during the pandemic, according to Deutsche Welle, which said the coalition government has settled on new COVID measures to replace ones that expire on 19 Mar 2022. The new ones include basic steps such as masking on public transport and limiting regular testing to nursing homes and other vulnerable settings, though states can institute other measures if they experience future spikes (<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-new-daily-covid-19-infections-pass-250000-for-first-time/a-61075687" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.dw.com/en/germany-new-daily-covid-19-infections-pass-250000-for-first-time/a-61075687</a>).<br /><br />New Zealand, which is experiencing its worst surge, is feeling COVID-19 pressure on doctor\'s offices and hospitals, according to Radio New Zealand, which said general practice clinic workload has increased 50% and patient loads at Auckland hospitals are already above their worst-case scenarios (<a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/463054/watch-live-covid-19-briefing-it-is-still-going-to-be-messy-for-the-next-couple-of-weeks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/463054/watch-live-covid-19-briefing-it-is-still-going-to-be-messy-for-the-next-couple-of-weeks</a>).<br /><br />[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]<br /><br />--<br />Communicated by:<br />Mary Marshall<br /><br />----<br />[B] USA: coronavirus package<br />Date: Thu 10 Mar 2022<br />Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [abridged, edited]<br /><a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/covid-19-remains-high-uk-ba2-gains-ground" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/covid-19-remains-high-uk-ba2-gains-ground</a><br /><br /><br />The House of Representatives failed to include a USD 15 billion coronavirus pandemic package when it approved a USD 1.5 trillion spending bill yesterday [9 Mar 2022], signaling a major setback for the Biden administration. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said a separate COVID relief bill will be introduced, The Hill reports (<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/597589-pelosi-says-separate-coronavirus-relief-bill-will-be-put-on-the-floor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://thehill.com/homenews/house/597589-pelosi-says-separate-coronavirus-relief-bill-will-be-put-on-the-floor</a>).<br /><br />For weeks the administration has petitioned lawmakers to increase funding for pandemic-related relief packages, but the war in Ukraine and plummeting case counts have pushed the pandemic to the political back burner. The 7-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases is 37 685, with 1369 daily deaths, according to The New York Times tracker (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html</a>).<br /><br />In related news, a new poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) shows that 40% to 60% of Americans missed work during the omicron surge, and 6 of 10 Americans who earn USD 40 000 or less a year reported missing work owing to the most recent surge of the virus. Twenty percent of those polled said missing work had a significant impact on family finances.<br /><br />As the nation enters the 3rd year of the pandemic, many companies continue to change pandemic policies. United Airlines, one of the 1st major companies to announce vaccine mandates last summer [2021], announced it will allow workers who haven\'t been vaccinated against COVID-19 for religious or medical reasons to return at the end of the month [March 2022], the Wall Street Journal reports (<a href="https://on.wsj.com/3tSo6AC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://on.wsj.com/3tSo6AC</a>).<br /><br />[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]<br /><br />--<br />Communicated by:<br />Mary Marshall<br /><br />******<br />[4] WHO: daily new cases reported (as of 10 Mar 2022)<br />Date: Thu 10 Mar 2022<br />Source: WHO [abridged, edited]<br /><a href="https://covid19.who.int/table" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://covid19.who.int/table</a><br /><br /><br />*Daily case reports as of 10 Mar 2022 16:48 CET<br /><br />Surveillance<br />------------<br />WHO region (no. countries/territories):<br />Total confirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Western Pacific Region (19): 30 049 923 (789 738) / 190 747 (1091)<br />European Region (61): 185 513 805 (800 258) / 1 897 675 (2392)<br />South-East Asia Region (10): 56 335 465 (48 894) / 767 622 (456)<br />Eastern Mediterranean Region (22): 21 375 560 (12 670) / 337 612 (255)<br />Region of the Americas (54): 148 475 359 (147 136) / 2 654 909 (2865)<br />African Region (49): 8 478 759 (18 229) / 170 507 (104)<br />Cases on an international conveyance: 764 (0) / 13 (0)<br /><br />Confirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)<br />Grand total: 450 229 635 (1 816 925) / 6 019 085 (7163)<br /><br />--<br />Communicated by:<br />ProMED<br /><br />[Data by country, area, or territory for 10 Mar 2022 can be accessed at <a href="https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20WHO%20Data%20Tables%20MAR10_1647026659.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20WHO%20Data%20Tables%20MAR10_1647026659.pdf</a>.<br /><br />- The Americas region reported 8.0% of cases and 39.9% of deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported more than 148.47 million cases, 2nd to the European region as the most severely affected region.

She developed symptoms on 17 Nov 2021 and was admitted for treatment on 20 Nov 2021. She passed away on 4 Dec 2021.\r\n\r\nThe 2nd case involves a 79-year-old man living in Liuzhou in Guangxi who had visited a live poultry market before onset. He developed symptoms on 18 Nov 2021 and was admitted for treatment on 22 Nov 2021. He passed away on 3 Dec 2021.\r\n\r\nFrom 2014 to date [8 Mar 2022], 73 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by Mainland health authorities. "All novel influenza A infections, including H5N6, are notifiable infectious diseases in Hong Kong," a spokesman for the CHP said.\r\n\r\nTravellers to the Mainland or other affected areas must avoid visiting wet markets, live poultry markets or farms. They should be alert to the presence of backyard poultry when visiting relatives and friends. They should also avoid purchasing live or freshly slaughtered poultry, and avoid touching poultry/birds or their droppings. They should strictly observe personal and hand hygiene when visiting any place with live poultry.\r\n\r\nTravellers returning from affected areas should consult a doctor promptly if symptoms develop, and inform the doctor of their travel history for prompt diagnosis and treatment of potential diseases. It is essential to tell the doctor if they have seen any live poultry during travel, which may imply possible exposure to contaminated environments. This will enable the doctor to assess the possibility of avian influenza and arrange necessary investigations and appropriate treatment in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nWhile local surveillance, prevention and control measures are in place, the CHP will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments. The public should maintain strict personal, hand, food and environmental hygiene and take heed of the advice below when handling poultry:\r\n\r\n- Avoid touching poultry, birds, animals or their droppings;\r\n- When buying live chickens, do not touch them and their droppings. Do not blow at their bottoms. Wash eggs with detergent if soiled with faecal matter and cook and consume the eggs immediately. Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling chickens and eggs;\r\n- Eggs should be cooked well until the white and yolk become firm. Do not eat raw eggs or dip cooked food into any sauce with raw eggs. Poultry should be cooked thoroughly. If there is pinkish juice running from the cooked poultry or the middle part of its bone is still red, the poultry should be cooked again until fully done;\r\n- Wash hands frequently, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, before handling food or eating, and after going to the toilet, touching public installations or equipment such as escalator handrails, elevator control panels or door knobs, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing; and\r\n- Wear a mask if fever or respiratory symptoms develop, when going to a hospital or clinic, or while taking care of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe public may visit the CHP\'s pages for more information: the avian influenza page, the weekly Avian Influenza Report, global statistics and affected areas of avian influenza, the Facebook Page and the YouTube Channel [see source URL above for these web links].\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMahmoud Orabi\r\n<ahstandards@gmail.com>\n\n[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for sharing this update on human cases of avian influenza A/H5N6 in China.\r\n\r\nThe above report mentions 2 new cases of avian influenza A/H5N6 in mainland China, both fatal, increasing the total cases in 2022 to 11 (although these 2 cases can technically be included in the 2021 tally). Accordingly, from 2014 to date, 73 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by Mainland health authorities.\r\n\r\nAvian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry such as chickens or ducks. People mainly become infected with avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings, or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza.

She developed symptoms on 17 Nov 2021 and was admitted for treatment on 20 Nov 2021. She passed away on 4 Dec 2021.<br /><br />The 2nd case involves a 79-year-old man living in Liuzhou in Guangxi who had visited a live poultry market before onset. He developed symptoms on 18 Nov 2021 and was admitted for treatment on 22 Nov 2021. He passed away on 3 Dec 2021.<br /><br />From 2014 to date [8 Mar 2022], 73 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by Mainland health authorities. "All novel influenza A infections, including H5N6, are notifiable infectious diseases in Hong Kong," a spokesman for the CHP said.<br /><br />Travellers to the Mainland or other affected areas must avoid visiting wet markets, live poultry markets or farms. They should be alert to the presence of backyard poultry when visiting relatives and friends. They should also avoid purchasing live or freshly slaughtered poultry, and avoid touching poultry/birds or their droppings. They should strictly observe personal and hand hygiene when visiting any place with live poultry.<br /><br />Travellers returning from affected areas should consult a doctor promptly if symptoms develop, and inform the doctor of their travel history for prompt diagnosis and treatment of potential diseases. It is essential to tell the doctor if they have seen any live poultry during travel, which may imply possible exposure to contaminated environments. This will enable the doctor to assess the possibility of avian influenza and arrange necessary investigations and appropriate treatment in a timely manner.<br /><br />While local surveillance, prevention and control measures are in place, the CHP will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments. The public should maintain strict personal, hand, food and environmental hygiene and take heed of the advice below when handling poultry:<br /><br />- Avoid touching poultry, birds, animals or their droppings;<br />- When buying live chickens, do not touch them and their droppings. Do not blow at their bottoms. Wash eggs with detergent if soiled with faecal matter and cook and consume the eggs immediately. Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling chickens and eggs;<br />- Eggs should be cooked well until the white and yolk become firm. Do not eat raw eggs or dip cooked food into any sauce with raw eggs. Poultry should be cooked thoroughly. If there is pinkish juice running from the cooked poultry or the middle part of its bone is still red, the poultry should be cooked again until fully done;<br />- Wash hands frequently, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, before handling food or eating, and after going to the toilet, touching public installations or equipment such as escalator handrails, elevator control panels or door knobs, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing; and<br />- Wear a mask if fever or respiratory symptoms develop, when going to a hospital or clinic, or while taking care of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms.<br /><br />The public may visit the CHP\'s pages for more information: the avian influenza page, the weekly Avian Influenza Report, global statistics and affected areas of avian influenza, the Facebook Page and the YouTube Channel [see source URL above for these web links].<br /><br />--<br />Communicated by:<br />Mahmoud Orabi<br />&lt;ahstandards@gmail.com><br /><br />[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for sharing this update on human cases of avian influenza A/H5N6 in China.<br /><br />The above report mentions 2 new cases of avian influenza A/H5N6 in mainland China, both fatal, increasing the total cases in 2022 to 11 (although these 2 cases can technically be included in the 2021 tally). Accordingly, from 2014 to date, 73 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by Mainland health authorities.<br /><br />Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry such as chickens or ducks. People mainly become infected with avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings, or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza. The elderly, children and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infections.<br /><br />Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. Intensive surveillance should be continued to detect cases and early changes in transmissibility and infectivity of these viruses, as the frequency of cases appears to be increasing. - Mod.UBA<br

This is the state\'s 1st confirmed case of HPAI since 2015.\r\n\r\n"While Nebraska has not seen HPAI in a backyard or commercial poultry flock within the state this year [2022], the finding of this single goose adds Nebraska to a long list of states with confirmed cases of HPAI," said State Veterinarian Dr. Roger Dudley. "Infected wild birds can carry the disease to new areas when migrating, so we encourage backyard poultry and commercial poultry flocks to continue to remain vigilant, practice good biosecurity and report sick or dying birds immediately."\r\n\r\nThe Nebraska Department of Agriculture and the Kansas Department of Agriculture\'s (KDA) Division of Animal Health encourage poultry owners to take steps to protect their commercial and backyard flocks from avian influenza by monitoring their birds for symptoms and by implementing biosecurity practices.\r\n\r\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza is a highly contagious viral disease that can infect chickens, turkeys, and other birds and can cause severe illness and/or sudden death. HPAI has been identified in backyard flocks as well as commercial operations in neighboring states; it has not been detected in Kansas.\r\n\r\n"Protecting the poultry in the state is a high priority, and we need all poultry owners to be part of the effort to prevent the spread of disease in Kansas," said Animal Health Commissioner Justin Smith. "Our best defense is to follow strict biosecurity practices and vigilantly monitor birds for any signs of illness."\r\n\r\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the recent HPAI detections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States. Avian influenza does not present a food safety risk. Poultry and eggs are safe to eat when handled and cooked properly.\r\n\r\nAs part of existing avian influenza response plans, federal and state partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flock. The United States has the strongest avian influenza surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets and in migratory wild bird populations.\r\n\r\nFor more information about HPAI, including current status of the confirmed cases in other states as well as more information about biosecurity for your flock, go to the KDA\'s avian influenza webpage at <agriculture.ks.gov/AvianInfluenza> or call 785-564-6601.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n[ProMED map of Nebraska, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701931,23160>\r\nNebraska county map: <https://geology.com/county-map/nebraska-county-map.gif>]\r\n\r\n******\r\nCanada\r\n[3] New Brunswick (Albert County): great black-backed gull\r\nDate: Wed 9 Mar 2022 16:05 AST\r\nSource: Global News [edited]\r\n<https://globalnews.ca/news/8670483/avian-flu-new-brunswick-black-backed-gull/>\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Brunswick has detected a case of the avian flu in a great black-backed gull in the Riverview area [Albert County].

At the same time, we have seen time and again that large-scale population movements, insecurity and hampered access contribute greatly to the emergence and/or spread of infectious diseases, such as polio.\r\n• A national supplemental polio immunization campaign targeting nearly 140 000 children throughout Ukraine who had not been vaccinated against polio began on 1 Feb 2022, but is currently paused, as health authorities have shifted focus towards emergency services. Surveillance to detect and report new cases of polio is also disrupted, increasing the risk of undetected spread of the disease among vulnerable populations. The GPEI is working to urgently develop contingency plans to support Ukraine and prevent further spread of polio.\r\n• The GPEI has a long history of working in a variety of complex environments and will continue to adapt its operations to the reality on the ground, to the degree possible, without compromising on the safety and security of health workers. At the same time, immunization and surveillance is being assessed in neighbouring countries, to minimize the risk and consequences of any potential infectious disease emergence/spread resulting from the current large-scale population movements. It is critical that necessary resources are mobilized and made available to assist with the humanitarian needs, including relief, disease response/prevention efforts both in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries.\r\n \r\nYemen\r\n• No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) was reported this week.

Other areas with documented cVDPVs through environmental sampling include cVDPV2 in Cote d'Ivoire and Mauritania, and cVDPV3 in the Palestinian Authority.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the charts showing the virus isolates and date of most recent isolate by source (AFP case other humans (non-AFP infected) and environmental samples) for WPVs and cVDPVs for this past week (as of 9 Mar 2022) have not been posted as yet (see <https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/circulating-vaccine-derived-poliovirus/>). It would be interesting to see the time table of positive samples... did the ESs pre-date the identification of the AFP case (the answer seems to be yes reading between the lines) and did the positive ESs in the Palestinian Authority precede, follow or were basically chronologically the same? \r\n\r\nAccording to the Polio Eradication Initiative website, as of 1 Mar 2022 there had only been 2 countries reporting isolation of cVDPV3 since 2016 - China (positive ES 25 Jan 2021) and Somalia (positive AFP case 7 Sep 2018). Unless there has been undetected circulation in those countries for 1 and 3 years, respectively, it is highly likely this virus is a new outbreak in the region. \r\n\r\nOther information not mentioned is whether the cVDPV3 isolates in the Palestinian Authority are genetically related to those identified in Israel. \r\n\r\nA map showing Israel and the Palestinian Authority can be found at: <https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/israel_map.htm>.\r\n\r\nA map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at <https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/>. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Israel, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan, cVDPV1 in Madagascar and Yemen, and WPV1 in Afghanistan and Pakistan. - Mod.MPP]\r\n\r\n******\r\n[2] Israel, Palestine cVDPV3\r\nDate: Thu 10 Mar 2022\r\nSource: Polio Eradication Initiative [edited]\r\n<https://polioeradication.org/news-post/circulating-vaccine-derived-poliovirus-confirmed-in-israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territory/>\r\n\r\n\r\nCirculating vaccine-derived poliovirus confirmed in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nOn Monday [7 Mar 2022], a case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3) was confirmed in an unvaccinated girl aged 3 years and 9 months in Israel. The girl had developed acute flaccid paralysis and upon testing of her stool, poliovirus was confirmed. Further testing of the poliovirus isolated from the girl revealed genetic links to VDPV3-strains detected in environmental samples collected from sites in in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory between September 2021 and January 2022. These isolates, previously classified as ambiguous VDPV3, have now been reclassified as circulating VDPV3 (cVDPV3). This confirms an outbreak of cVDPV3 in both Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory.\r\n\r\nLocal health authorities are conducting field, epidemiological and virological investigations, to determine more clearly the source and origin of the isolated virus, and potential risk of further spread associated with it.\r\n\r\nExperts from the headquarters, regional and country offices of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) partnership, which includes WHO, Rotary International (RI), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunization (GAVI), are working together to help ensure an appropriate response and cessation of this outbreak.\r\n\r\nDetection of this cVDPV3 underscores the importance of strong disease surveillance and high population immunity levels, in order to minimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus introduction or emergence.\r\n\r\nThe GPEI partnership urges all health authorities to enhance surveillance for poliovirus and implement enhanced vaccination response to prevent further transmission, so that no child is at risk of lifelong paralysis from a disease that can so easily be prevented. GPEI is committed to assisting the health authorities in their efforts to stop the cVDPV3 outbreak.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[Our thanks to Helen Branswell for alerting us to the identification of cVDPV3 as the causative virus in this event. We await further information on the provenance of the cVDPV3 identified.

It would be interesting to see the time table of positive samples... did the ESs pre-date the identification of the AFP case (the answer seems to be yes reading between the lines) and did the positive ESs in the Palestinian Authority precede, follow or were basically chronologically the same? <br /><br />According to the Polio Eradication Initiative website, as of 1 Mar 2022 there had only been 2 countries reporting isolation of cVDPV3 since 2016 - China (positive ES 25 Jan 2021) and Somalia (positive AFP case 7 Sep 2018). Unless there has been undetected circulation in those countries for 1 and 3 years, respectively, it is highly likely this virus is a new outbreak in the region. <br /><br />Other information not mentioned is whether the cVDPV3 isolates in the Palestinian Authority are genetically related to those identified in Israel. <br /><br />A map showing Israel and the Palestinian Authority can be found at: <a href="https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/israel_map.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/israel_map.htm</a>.<br /><br />A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at <a href="https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/</a>.

The girl had developed acute flaccid paralysis and upon testing of her stool, poliovirus was confirmed. Further testing of the poliovirus isolated from the girl revealed genetic links to VDPV3-strains detected in environmental samples collected from sites in in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory between September 2021 and January 2022. These isolates, previously classified as ambiguous VDPV3, have now been reclassified as circulating VDPV3 (cVDPV3). This confirms an outbreak of cVDPV3 in both Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory.<br /><br />Local health authorities are conducting field, epidemiological and virological investigations, to determine more clearly the source and origin of the isolated virus, and potential risk of further spread associated with it.<br /><br />Experts from the headquarters, regional and country offices of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) partnership, which includes WHO, Rotary International (RI), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United Nations Children\'s Fund (UNICEF), Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunization (GAVI), are working together to help ensure an appropriate response and cessation of this outbreak.<br /><br />Detection of this cVDPV3 underscores the importance of strong disease surveillance and high population immunity levels, in order to minimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus introduction or emergence.<br /><br />The GPEI partnership urges all health authorities to enhance surveillance for poliovirus and implement enhanced vaccination response to prevent further transmission, so that no child is at risk of lifelong paralysis from a disease that can so easily be prevented. GPEI is committed to assisting the health authorities in their efforts to stop the cVDPV3 outbreak.<br /><br />--<br />Communicated by:<br />ProMED<br /><br />[Our thanks to Helen Branswell for alerting us to the identification of cVDPV3 as the causative virus in this event. We await further information on the provenance of the cVDPV3 identified.

They appear more in urban environments and have become adapted to reproduce in small water collection sites generated by people.\r\n\r\nThey usually bite during the day and not at night and their bite generates a strong inflammatory reaction that is accompanied by a great irritation. They move nimbly close to the ground and no buzzing is heard.\r\n\r\nThe female mosquitoes are the ones that bite, since they need to feed on blood to reproduce. They also need water as breeding sites to complete their development. They lay their eggs in the water, from which the larvae emerge, then transform into pupae (both are aquatic) and finally become adult mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nMosquitoes that bite humans need to be breeding very close to people. That is why the most effective measure against them is to monitor or eliminate their breeding sites.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMahmoud Orabi\r\n<ahstandards@gmail.com>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Mahmoud Orabi for submitting this report.\r\n\r\nThis is yet another example of movement of _Aedes aegypti_ to a new location. The possible mechanism of transport in this case is not mentioned. This is the 2nd report of the appearance of _A. aegypti_ in the Canary Islands. The 1st was in 2017.

They appear more in urban environments and have become adapted to reproduce in small water collection sites generated by people.<br /><br />They usually bite during the day and not at night and their bite generates a strong inflammatory reaction that is accompanied by a great irritation. They move nimbly close to the ground and no buzzing is heard.<br /><br />The female mosquitoes are the ones that bite, since they need to feed on blood to reproduce. They also need water as breeding sites to complete their development. They lay their eggs in the water, from which the larvae emerge, then transform into pupae (both are aquatic) and finally become adult mosquitoes.<br /><br />Mosquitoes that bite humans need to be breeding very close to people. That is why the most effective measure against them is to monitor or eliminate their breeding sites.<br /><br />--<br />Communicated by:<br />Mahmoud Orabi<br />&lt;ahstandards@gmail.com><br /><br />[ProMED-mail thanks Mahmoud Orabi for submitting this report.<br /><br />This is yet another example of movement of _Aedes aegypti_ to a new location.

Although this has not been conclusively proven, scientists believe that an overactive and abnormal immune response to SARS-CoV-2 may be responsible for the damage seen in severe COVID-19. \r\n\r\nGenetics influence the response of the innate immune system. And so, genetic differences may help explain why some people are more likely to develop severe COVID-19.\r\n\r\nPrevious research has identified relationships between different genetic factors, hospitalization, and the need for ventilation due to COVID-19.

"It was also surprising to see such a consistent protective effect of adhesion molecules with severe COVID-19."\r\n\r\nThe strengths of the study included its design and use of Mendelian randomization. Weaknesses include the reliance on data from other studies, which could be subject to error despite quality control measures.\r\n\r\nDr. Palmos stated, "Clinical studies in patients would need to be carried out first to confirm our findings. One such study is the COVID-Clinical Neuroscience Study, which is investigating the causes behind different aspects of COVID-19." [<https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/covid-clinical-neuroscience-study/>]\r\n\r\nDr. Youssef told MNT, "Once you start applying [the data] widely, then you understand the [true] impact." He believes that this study "adds another piece in that puzzle [...] that would inform which interventions would be offered to patients depending on their risk profile."\r\n\r\n[Byline: Lori Uildriks]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n******\r\n[2] Host genetic variation\r\nDate: Mon 7 Mar 2022\r\nSource: Nature [abridged, edited]\r\n<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04576-6>\r\n\r\n\r\nCitation\r\nKousathanas, A., Pairo-Castineira, E., Rawlik, K. et al.

Host genetic variation influences the development of illness requiring critical care or hospitalization following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The GenOMICC (Genetics of Mortality in Critical Care) study enables the comparison of genomes from critically-ill cases with population controls in order to find underlying disease mechanisms. Here, we use whole genome sequencing in 7491 critically-ill cases compared with 48 400 controls to discover and replicate 23 independent variants that significantly predispose to critical COVID-19. We identify 16 new independent associations, including variants within genes involved in interferon signalling (IL10RB, PLSCR1), leucocyte differentiation (BCL11A), and blood type antigen secretor status (FUT2). Using transcriptome-wide association and colocalisation to infer the effect of gene expression on disease severity, we find evidence implicating multiple genes, including reduced expression of a membrane flippase (ATP11A), and increased mucin expression (MUC1), in critical disease. Mendelian randomisation provides evidence in support of causal roles for myeloid cell adhesion molecules (SELE, ICAM5, CD209) and coagulation factor F8, all of which are potentially druggable targets. Our results are broadly consistent with a multi-component model of COVID-19 pathophysiology, in which at least 2 distinct mechanisms can predispose to life-threatening disease: failure to control viral replication, or an enhanced tendency towards pulmonary inflammation and intravascular coagulation. We show that comparison between critically-ill cases and population controls is highly efficient for detection of therapeutically-relevant mechanisms of disease.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n\r\n******\r\n[3] Mental decline\r\nDate: Wed 9 Mar 2022\r\nSource: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]\r\n<https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/mental-decline-seen-older-covid-patients-1-year-later>\r\n\r\n\r\nMental decline seen in older COVID patients 1 year later\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\nCognitive impairment was more common among COVID-19 patients 60 years and older--particularly those with severe illness--released from hospitals in Wuhan, China, than among their uninfected peers, according to a 1-year follow-up study yesterday in JAMA Neurology.\r\n\r\nA team led by researchers at Daping Hospital in Chongqing, China, followed 1438 COVID-19 survivors aged 60 and older released from one of 3 dedicated COVID-19 hospitals in Wuhan from 10 Feb -- 10 Apr 2020, and compared them with 438 of their uninfected spouses.\r\n\r\nBecause pre-COVID cognitive status wasn\'t available, family members provided their perceptions of cognitive changes using the Chinese version of the short form of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE). The questionnaire contains 16 items that rate changes in memory and other domains, with decline defined as an item score of 3.5 or higher. \r\n\r\nTrained raters interviewed COVID-19 patients at 12 months over the phone to evaluate cognition using the Chinese version of Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status-40 (TICS-40), which includes 10 variables and has a maximum of 40 points. A score of 20 or lower was considered indicative of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), while a score of 12 or lower indicated dementia, and a decrease of 3 points or more was considered clinically meaningful cognitive decline.\r\n\r\nOf the COVID-19 patients. 48.1% were men, median age was 69 years, and none had a history of dementia. The control group was 50.7% men, and the median age was 67 years.\r\n\r\nThe incidence of impaired cognition among COVID-19 survivors was 12.5% 12 months after hospital release. COVID-19 survivors had lower TICS-40 scores than controls at both 6 months (median, 29 vs 30 points) and 12 months (29 vs 31).\r\n\r\nSeverely ill patients had lower TICS-40 scores than those with milder illness and controls (median score, 24 vs 30 vs 31) at 6 months; at 12 months, they had lower scores than controls (22.5 vs 31). Patients with mild or moderate illness and controls differed in IQCODE scores but not TICS-40 over follow-up.\r\n\r\nAmong severely ill COVID-19 patients, 10% had dementia and 26.5% had MCI at 6 months. At 12 months, 15% had dementia and 26.2% had MCI, much higher than in those with milder illness (dementia, 0.8%; MCI, 5.4%) and controls (dementia, 0.7%; MCI, 5%). Survivors of mild or moderate COVID-19 and controls had similar incidences of dementia and MCI at both 6 and 12 months.\r\n\r\nSevere illness was tied to a higher risk of early-onset cognitive decline (odds ratio [OR], 4.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.3 -- 7.2), late-onset cognitive decline (OR, 7.6; 95% CI, 3.6 -- 16), and progressive cognitive decline (OR, 19; 95% CI, 9.1 -- 39.5), while milder COVID-19 was associated with a higher risk of early-onset cognitive decline (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3 -- 2.3) after adjusting for age, sex, educational attainment, body mass index (BMI), and underlying illnesses.\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of progressive decline was 21.2% with severe COVID-19, 1.2% with non-severe COVID-19, and 2.3% in controls.\r\n\r\nSevere COVID-19 was linked to a higher risk of cognitive impairment at 12 months (OR, 9.1; 95% CI, 5.6 -- 14.8), but milder illness was not (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.7 -- 1.8), after adjusting for age, sex, educational attainment, BMI, and underlying illnesses.\r\n\r\nAmong a subset of 438 patients and their spouses, COVID-19 survivors were older (median age, 68 vs 67 years) and had a higher incidence of hypertension (47% vs 34.5%). Both nonsevere (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1 -- 3) and severe COVID-19 (OR, 5.9; 95% CI, 3.6 -- 9.8) in this group were tied to a higher risk of cognitive impairment at 12 months, after adjustment for risk factors.\r\n\r\nThe study authors noted that impaired cognition is common in the months after COVID-19 infection, especially among older patients. "It is worth noting that 21% of individuals with severe cases in this cohort experienced progressive cognitive decline, suggesting that COVID-19 may cause long-lasting damage to cognition," they wrote.\r\n\r\n"These findings imply that the pandemic may substantially contribute to the world dementia burden in the future."\r\n\r\nPotential factors in post-COVID cognitive decline, the authors said, include long-term low oxygen levels, chronic systemic inflammation, and direct viral invasion of the brain and resultant neuronal damage.\r\n\r\n"In this cohort study of COVID-19 survivors 60 years and older who were discharged from COVID-19-designated hospitals in Wuhan, China, SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially severe infection, was associated with an increase in risk of longitudinal cognitive decline," the researchers concluded.

Median patient age was 55 years, 70.6% were Hispanic, 57.9% were men, and 90% needed supplemental oxygen during hospitalization.\r\n\r\nThe rate of hospital readmission or death within 14 days of release was 9.1% in patients who continued dexamethasone, compared with 11.4% among patients who didn\'t, but the difference wasn\'t statistically significant.\r\n\r\nThe adjusted odds ratio (OR) for readmission or death within 14 days was 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58 -- 1.30) for patients who continued dexamethasone, compared with those who did not. A sensitivity analysis that limited the treatment group to those given exactly 10 days of dexamethasone showed comparable results (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.55 -- 1.43).\r\n\r\nA subgroup analysis stratified by length of dexamethasone therapy in the hospital also yielded similar findings (1 to 3 days: OR, 0.71; 4 to 9 days: OR, 1.01), oxygen requirement at release (room air: OR, 0.91; supplemental oxygen use: OR, 0.76), and illness duration at release (10 days or less: OR, 0.81; more than 10 days: OR, 0.94).\r\n\r\nThe study authors noted that corticosteroids like dexamethasone were the first type of medication to show a survival benefit in severely ill COVID-19 patients and are now a mainstay of hospital treatment. Because early readmissions after hospital release are largely due to respiratory causes that probably reflect illness progression, the authors had theorized that continuing corticosteroids could reduce these outcomes.\r\n\r\n"Continuing treatment with dexamethasone, 6mg/d, at discharge was not associated with a reduction in 14-day all-cause readmission or mortality," the researchers wrote. "This finding suggests that dexamethasone should not be routinely prescribed beyond discharge."\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\r\n\r\n[Citation.

JAMA Netw Open. 2022;5(3):e221455. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.1455\r\n\r\nIntroduction. Corticosteroids were the first medication class to demonstrate mortality benefit among patients with COVID-19 and are now a cornerstone of COVID-19 treatment. In the Randomized Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) trial, the use of dexamethasone, 6 mg/d, up to 10 days or until discharge resulted in lower mortality. However, with no standardized discharge practices, corticosteroid prescription practices at discharge have varied.\r\n\r\nConclusions and relevance. In this cohort study of patients with COVID-19, continuing treatment with dexamethasone, 6mg/d, at discharge was not associated with a reduction in 14-day all-cause readmission or mortality. This finding suggests that dexamethasone should not be routinely prescribed beyond discharge for individuals with COVID-19. - Mod.LK]\r\n\r\n********\r\n[5] WHO: Daily new cases reported (as of 9 Mar 2022)\r\nDate: Wed 9 Mar 2022\r\nSource: WHO [abridged, edited]\r\n<https://covid19.who.int/table>\r\n\r\n\r\n*Daily case reports as of 9 Mar 2022 16:48 CET\r\n\r\nSurveillance\r\n------------\r\nWHO region (no. countries/territories):\r\nTotal confirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nWestern Pacific Region (19): 29 262 597 (730 009) / 189 656 (892)\r\nEuropean Region (61): 184 618 493 (777 549) / 1 894 846 (2509)\r\nSouth East Asia Region (10): 56 285 919 (55 423) / 767 165 (533)\r\nEastern Mediterranean Region (22): 21 362 890 (14 737) / 337 357 (253)\r\nRegion of the Americas (54): 148 322 100 (125 821) / 2 652 042 (2289)\r\nAfrican Region (49): 8 460 530 (669) / 170 403 (11)\r\nCases on an international conveyance: 764 (0) / 13 (0)\r\n\r\nConfirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)\r\nGrand total: 448 313 293 (1 704 208) / 6 011 482 (6487)\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n[Data by country, area, or territory for 9 Mar 2022 can be accessed at \r\n<https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20WHO%20Data%20Tables%20MAR9_1646937489.pdf>.\r\n\r\n- The Americas region reported 7.3% of cases and 35.2% of deaths in the past 24 hours having reported more than 148.32 million cases, 2nd to the European region, as the most severely affected region.

proteins and the risk of hospitalization, the need for respiratory support, or the risk of death from severe COVID-19.<br />- While certain blood proteins were associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19, others were protective.<br />- Confirming the findings and exploring their clinical applicability will require further research.<br /><br />Often, people with severe COVID-19 require hospitalization with intensive care and ventilation. Although this has not been conclusively proven, scientists believe that an overactive and abnormal immune response to SARS-CoV-2 may be responsible for the damage seen in severe COVID-19. <br /><br />Genetics influence the response of the innate immune system. And so, genetic differences may help explain why some people are more likely to develop severe COVID-19.<br /><br />Previous research has identified relationships between different genetic factors, hospitalization, and the need for ventilation due to COVID-19.

They looked for blood proteins associated with the risk of hospitalization, the need for respiratory support, and death from severe COVID-19. The team has published its results in the journalPLOS Genetics.

"It was also surprising to see such a consistent protective effect of adhesion molecules with severe COVID-19."<br /><br />The strengths of the study included its design and use of Mendelian randomization. Weaknesses include the reliance on data from other studies, which could be subject to error despite quality control measures.<br /><br />Dr. Palmos stated, "Clinical studies in patients would need to be carried out first to confirm our findings. One such study is the COVID-Clinical Neuroscience Study, which is investigating the causes behind different aspects of COVID-19."

The GenOMICC (Genetics of Mortality in Critical Care) study enables the comparison of genomes from critically-ill cases with population controls in order to find underlying disease mechanisms. Here, we use whole genome sequencing in 7491 critically-ill cases compared with 48 400 controls to discover and replicate 23 independent variants that significantly predispose to critical COVID-19. We identify 16 new independent associations, including variants within genes involved in interferon signalling (IL10RB, PLSCR1), leucocyte differentiation (BCL11A), and blood type antigen secretor status (FUT2). Using transcriptome-wide association and colocalisation to infer the effect of gene expression on disease severity, we find evidence implicating multiple genes, including reduced expression of a membrane flippase (ATP11A), and increased mucin expression (MUC1), in critical disease. Mendelian randomisation provides evidence in support of causal roles for myeloid cell adhesion molecules (SELE, ICAM5, CD209) and coagulation factor F8, all of which are potentially druggable targets. Our results are broadly consistent with a multi-component model of COVID-19 pathophysiology, in which at least 2 distinct mechanisms can predispose to life-threatening disease: failure to control viral replication, or an enhanced tendency towards pulmonary inflammation and intravascular coagulation. We show that comparison between critically-ill cases and population controls is highly efficient for detection of therapeutically-relevant mechanisms of disease.<br /><br />--<br />Communicated by:<br />Mary Marshall<br /><br />******<br />[3] Mental decline<br />Date: Wed 9 Mar 2022<br />Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]<br /><a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/mental-decline-seen-older-covid-patients-1-year-later" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/mental-decline-seen-older-covid-patients-1-year-later</a><br /><br /><br />Mental decline seen in older COVID patients 1 year later<br />--------------------------------------------------------<br />Cognitive impairment was more common among COVID-19 patients 60 years and older--particularly those with severe illness--released from hospitals in Wuhan, China, than among their uninfected peers, according to a 1-year follow-up study yesterday in JAMA Neurology.<br /><br />A team led by researchers at Daping Hospital in Chongqing, China, followed 1438 COVID-19 survivors aged 60 and older released from one of 3 dedicated COVID-19 hospitals in Wuhan from 10 Feb -- 10 Apr 2020, and compared them with 438 of their uninfected spouses.<br /><br />Because pre-COVID cognitive status wasn\'t available, family members provided their perceptions of cognitive changes using the Chinese version of the short form of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE). The questionnaire contains 16 items that rate changes in memory and other domains, with decline defined as an item score of 3.5 or higher. <br /><br />Trained raters interviewed COVID-19 patients at 12 months over the phone to evaluate cognition using the Chinese version of Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status-40 (TICS-40), which includes 10 variables and has a maximum of 40 points. A score of 20 or lower was considered indicative of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), while a score of 12 or lower indicated dementia, and a decrease of 3 points or more was considered clinically meaningful cognitive decline.<br /><br />Of the COVID-19 patients. 48.1% were men, median age was 69 years, and none had a history of dementia. The control group was 50.7% men, and the median age was 67 years.<br /><br />The incidence of impaired cognition among COVID-19 survivors was 12.5% 12 months after hospital release. COVID-19 survivors had lower TICS-40 scores than controls at both 6 months (median, 29 vs 30 points) and 12 months (29 vs 31).<br /><br />Severely ill patients had lower TICS-40 scores than those with milder illness and controls (median score, 24 vs 30 vs 31) at 6 months; at 12 months, they had lower scores than controls (22.5 vs 31). Patients with mild or moderate illness and controls differed in IQCODE scores but not TICS-40 over follow-up.<br /><br />Among severely ill COVID-19 patients, 10% had dementia and 26.5% had MCI at 6 months. At 12 months, 15% had dementia and 26.2% had MCI, much higher than in those with milder illness (dementia, 0.8%; MCI, 5.4%) and controls (dementia, 0.7%; MCI, 5%). Survivors of mild or moderate COVID-19 and controls had similar incidences of dementia and MCI at both 6 and 12 months.<br /><br />Severe illness was tied to a higher risk of early-onset cognitive decline (odds ratio [OR], 4.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.3 -- 7.2), late-onset cognitive decline (OR, 7.6; 95% CI, 3.6 -- 16), and progressive cognitive decline (OR, 19; 95% CI, 9.1 -- 39.5), while milder COVID-19 was associated with a higher risk of early-onset cognitive decline (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3 -- 2.3) after adjusting for age, sex, educational attainment, body mass index (BMI), and underlying illnesses.<br /><br />The prevalence of progressive decline was 21.2% with severe COVID-19, 1.2% with non-severe COVID-19, and 2.3% in controls.<br /><br />Severe COVID-19 was linked to a higher risk of cognitive impairment at 12 months (OR, 9.1; 95% CI, 5.6 -- 14.8), but milder illness was not (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.7 -- 1.8), after adjusting for age, sex, educational attainment, BMI, and underlying illnesses.<br /><br />Among a subset of 438 patients and their spouses, COVID-19 survivors were older (median age, 68 vs 67 years) and had a higher incidence of hypertension (47% vs 34.5%). Both nonsevere (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1 -- 3) and severe COVID-19 (OR, 5.9; 95% CI, 3.6 -- 9.8) in this group were tied to a higher risk of cognitive impairment at 12 months, after adjustment for risk factors.<br /><br />The study authors noted that impaired cognition is common in the months after COVID-19 infection, especially among older patients. "It is worth noting that 21% of individuals with severe cases in this cohort experienced progressive cognitive decline, suggesting that COVID-19 may cause long-lasting damage to cognition," they wrote.<br /><br />"These findings imply that the pandemic may substantially contribute to the world dementia burden in the future."<br /><br />Potential factors in post-COVID cognitive decline, the authors said, include long-term low oxygen levels, chronic systemic inflammation, and direct viral invasion of the brain and resultant neuronal damage.<br /><br />"In this cohort study of COVID-19 survivors 60 years and older who were discharged from COVID-19-designated hospitals in Wuhan, China, SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially severe infection, was associated with an increase in risk of longitudinal cognitive decline," the researchers concluded. "The findings highlight the importance of immediate measures to deal with this challenge."<br /><br />[Byline: Mary Van Beusekom]<br /><br />--<br />Communicated by:<br />Mary Marshall<br /><br />[Citation.

Median patient age was 55 years, 70.6% were Hispanic, 57.9% were men, and 90% needed supplemental oxygen during hospitalization.<br /><br />The rate of hospital readmission or death within 14 days of release was 9.1% in patients who continued dexamethasone, compared with 11.4% among patients who didn\'t, but the difference wasn\'t statistically significant.<br /><br />The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for readmission or death within 14 days was 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58 -- 1.30) for patients who continued dexamethasone, compared with those who did not. A sensitivity analysis that limited the treatment group to those given exactly 10 days of dexamethasone showed comparable results (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.55 -- 1.43).<br /><br />A subgroup analysis stratified by length of dexamethasone therapy in the hospital also yielded similar findings (1 to 3 days: OR, 0.71; 4 to 9 days: OR, 1.01), oxygen requirement at release (room air: OR, 0.91; supplemental oxygen use: OR, 0.76), and illness duration at release (10 days or less: OR, 0.81; more than 10 days: OR, 0.94).<br /><br />The study authors noted that corticosteroids like dexamethasone were the first type of medication to show a survival benefit in severely ill COVID-19 patients and are now a mainstay of hospital treatment. Because early readmissions after hospital release are largely due to respiratory causes that probably reflect illness progression, the authors had theorized that continuing corticosteroids could reduce these outcomes.<br /><br />"Continuing treatment with dexamethasone, 6mg/d, at discharge was not associated with a reduction in 14-day all-cause readmission or mortality," the researchers wrote. "This finding suggests that dexamethasone should not be routinely prescribed beyond discharge."<br /><br />--<br />Communicated by:<br />Mary Marshall<br />&lt;mjm2020@googlemail.com><br /><br />[Citation.

JAMA Netw Open. 2022;5(3):e221455. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.1455<br /><br />Introduction. Corticosteroids were the first medication class to demonstrate mortality benefit among patients with COVID-19 and are now a cornerstone of COVID-19 treatment. In the Randomized Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) trial, the use of dexamethasone, 6 mg/d, up to 10 days or until discharge resulted in lower mortality. However, with no standardized discharge practices, corticosteroid prescription practices at discharge have varied.<br /><br />Conclusions and relevance. In this cohort study of patients with COVID-19, continuing treatment with dexamethasone, 6mg/d, at discharge was not associated with a reduction in 14-day all-cause readmission or mortality. This finding suggests that dexamethasone should not be routinely prescribed beyond discharge for individuals with COVID-19. - Mod.LK]<br /><br />********<br />[5] WHO: Daily new cases reported (as of 9 Mar 2022)<br />Date: Wed 9 Mar 2022<br />Source: WHO [abridged, edited]<br /><a href="https://covid19.who.int/table" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://covid19.who.int/table</a><br /><br /><br />*Daily case reports as of 9 Mar 2022 16:48 CET<br /><br />Surveillance<br />------------<br />WHO region (no. countries/territories):<br />Total confirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Western Pacific Region (19): 29 262 597 (730 009) / 189 656 (892)<br />European Region (61): 184 618 493 (777 549) / 1 894 846 (2509)<br />South East Asia Region (10): 56 285 919 (55 423) / 767 165 (533)<br />Eastern Mediterranean Region (22): 21 362 890 (14 737) / 337 357 (253)<br />Region of the Americas (54): 148 322 100 (125 821) / 2 652 042 (2289)<br />African Region (49): 8 460 530 (669) / 170 403 (11)<br />Cases on an international conveyance: 764 (0) / 13 (0)<br /><br />Confirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)<br />Grand total: 448 313 293 (1 704 208) / 6 011 482 (6487)<br /><br />--<br />Communicated by:<br />ProMED<br /><br />[Data by country, area, or territory for 9 Mar 2022 can be accessed at <br /><a href="https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20WHO%20Data%20Tables%20MAR9_1646937489.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20WHO%20Data%20Tables%20MAR9_1646937489.pdf</a>.<br /><br />- The Americas region reported 7.3% of cases and 35.2% of deaths in the past 24 hours having reported more than 148.32 million cases, 2nd to the European region, as the most severely affected region.

JEV is a mosquito-borne viral disease that is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito to people and animals -- mostly pigs and horses.\r\n\r\nSunPork Group CEO and managing director Dr Robert van Barneveld said several of their sites in the eastern states had been impacted and they were working through it. "One of the Goondiwindi farms has been infected...we have an infected premises in New South Wales.... There are infected premises all down the east coast," Dr van Barneveld said. "We\'ve been working on this endlessly since Friday night [25 Feb 2022] when we first were made aware that it was an issue."\r\n\r\nDr van Barneveld said it was not a new occurrence and there was no cause for alarm in the pork industry. "The piggeries are innocent bystanders. Pigs are not going to infect other pigs. It\'s not going to have a negative effect at an abattoir. The pork is safe to eat. It\'s play on," he said. "If you\'re going to have an emergency animal disease, this is the one to have. We\'re not actually anticipating any significant disruption to our operations at all."\r\n\r\nPigs are the focus from a human health perspective, as they can infect mosquitoes that can then infect humans. This is not the case with horses.\r\n\r\nHumans can become infected with JEV through the bite of an infected mosquito. The virus cannot be transmitted between humans, and it cannot be caught through eating pork or pig products.\r\n\r\n"If a mosquito bites people and if it bites horses, they\'re called dead-end hosts, so it doesn\'t pass on. If it bites a pig -- a pig\'s an amplifier -- so if another mosquito bites that pig while it\'s viremic, which is a very short period of time, it can transmit in the mosquito population," Dr van Barneveld said. "That\'s why there are controls around the movement of pigs."\r\n\r\nDr van Barneveld said authorities were working well together to protect humans and animals. "This is about protecting people and the bad guy in the process is a mosquito and the weather patterns," he said. "The state health departments and the state chief veterinary officers have worked extremely well together. They understand that eradicating it is going to be very unlikely and they\'re being very practical around the movement of pigs and making sure people are safe."\r\n\r\nHe said SunPork had done a lot of preparedness work around African swine fever and had good relationships with the state chief veterinary officers which puts it in a very good position to manage this. "When you get a disease like this, there are a whole stack of legislative instruments that are pushed into place that have to be executed, and they\'re following those processes. Everyone\'s fairly calm about it and [I] think we can manage through it with minimal disruption."\r\n\r\nA vaccine for horses and pigs is available in countries where the disease is endemic, but no JE vaccines for animals are registered for use in Australia, and there is no effective treatment for JE in animals.\r\n\r\nOn Friday [4 Mar 2022], Australia\'s Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Mark Schipp said JEV had been confirmed at 14 piggeries across NSW, SA, Queensland and Victoria. This follows a confirmed human case of JEV in Queensland. Queensland Health said the confirmed case had recent travel in regional southern Queensland and is currently being treated in a Brisbane hospital.\r\n\r\nLess than 1% of people infected may develop a serious illness such as encephalitis and experience symptoms including neck stiffness, severe headache and coma, and more rarely, permanent neurological complications or death.\r\n\r\nGoondiwindi and District Veterinary Services owner and vet Dr Trisha Pullos said the recent heavy rain in parts of Queensland and NSW had brought with it more mosquitoes and potentially more risk of JEV. "We\'ve had quite a bit of rain like everybody else, and the mozzies out here are brutal," Dr Pullos said.\r\n\r\nDr Pullos said the main issues were observed in piglets -- pigs didn\'t seem to be affected physically. "If the piglets are born dead or weak or malformed or something really unusual or if the sow aborts the whole litter -- that\'s the 1st sign," she said. "Pigs can amplify the virus. It\'s not transferable between humans; it seems to be just the mosquitoes that are how we can catch it, so if you can keep the mozzies off you, then we\'ll be a little bit safer."\r\n\r\nShe said it was important to get information from reliable sources and anyone who was worried should contact their vet. "Anybody who\'s got 2 pigs in the backyard, or a pig for the kids, or a little kill herd at the back of the property -- they need to contact their local vet and just say, \'Hey, I\'ve got 2 pigs here. What do I need to keep an eye out for?\' Then what we\'ll do is we\'ll let our district vet know who will then let the Chief Veterinary Officer know so we can try and track it a lot faster, because if someone goes and tells their neighbour but doesn\'t tell the vet then we\'re already behind the 8 ball."\r\n\r\nShe said there was a risk people had "bad news fatigue" and wouldn\'t take things seriously. "I\'ve found that everyone\'s a little bit worn out. There\'s been quite a few comments on our Facebook posts where people are just like, \'Not again\', or \'What now?\' \'Can it just end?\' We might be at risk of going, \'Oh, whatever\', and I want to make sure that they\'re not going to do that."\r\n\r\nJEV was detected in 3 people in the Torres Strait Islands in 1995. In 1998, 2 further cases were detected in people in Queensland, including one acquired on the Australian mainland.\r\n\r\nJEV is mostly transmitted by bites from infected mosquito vectors and is maintained in mosquito-waterbird or mosquito-waterbird-pig cycles. Waterbirds, particularly wading birds such as herons and egrets, are the main source from which transmission of JEV can occur. They are important amplifying hosts and hold enough virus in their blood to infect vectors for one to 7 days.\r\n\r\nPigs are also major amplifiers of the virus and develop levels of virus in the blood sufficient to infect vectors for around 4 days. Horses and a wide range of other species may be infected but do not develop levels of virus in the blood sufficient to infect mosquitoes, so are not involved in maintaining disease in an area.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Brandon Long]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n******\r\n[2] South Australia: pigs\r\nDate: Sun 6 Mar 2022 23:58 ACDT\r\nSource: ABC News [edited]\r\n<https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2022-03-07/japanese-encephalitis-outbreak-reaches-sa/100888042>\r\n\r\n\r\nKey points\r\n----------\r\n- The virus has been detected at 21 piggeries, 3 human cases have been confirmed, and the federal government predicts more cases will be detected.\r\n- The Chief Veterinary Officer says it\'s unusual to detect Japanese encephalitis (JE) so far south.\r\n- Pork SA [South Australia] says piggeries will still be able to operate, but restrictions are in place.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of Japanese encephalitis (JE) is now impacting 4 states as public health officials work to contain it. Since the potentially fatal mosquito-borne virus was first detected near the New South Wales-Victoria border last week, cases have been recorded in Queensland and South Australia.\r\n\r\nA Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment spokesperson said 3 cases of JE had been confirmed in humans, and a number of possible cases were under investigation. The spokesperson said it was anticipated that more cases would be confirmed shortly.\r\n\r\nAustralia\'s Chief Veterinary Officer Mark Schipp said animals at 21 piggeries had been infected. "We\'re mapping the presence of waterbirds, feral pigs or piggeries and people that have contracted the infection," he said. "We\'re undertaking mosquito surveillance and mosquito control on those farms."\r\n\r\nThere is a vaccine available as well. "That\'s the purpose of the mapping that we\'re undertaking at the moment -- to prioritise those vaccinations and then rolling the vaccinations out further from there," Mr Schipp said. The movement of pigs on farms with positive cases is being restricted.\r\n\r\nPork SA chairman Andrew Johnson is urging pork producers to report suspected cases. "Farmers that see any symptoms, they shouldn\'t be afraid to advise accordingly," he said.\r\n\r\nJE cannot be transmitted to humans by eating pork products and producers will still be able to transport livestock to abattoirs. "If there\'s a suspect case, or if there is a positive case, those farms will be issued a movement permit that will allow them to continue business," Mr Johnson said.\r\n\r\nThe virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and cannot be passed from livestock to humans. "Japanese encephalitis is a virus carried by mosquitoes from water birds or pigs to humans or horses," Mr Schipp said. "Pigs are an amplifying host, so they produce a lot of virus and the mosquitoes pick that up and carry it forward into humans and horses."\r\n\r\nJE is not normally found in Australia and health officials survey the Torres Strait and the Top End every year to check for outbreaks. This outbreak has been found along the Murray River corridor.\r\n\r\nMr Schipp said it was surprising to find JE so far south. "It will have a large impact on human health and industry," he said. "The impacts on tourism, for example, could be significant. We\'re doing everything we can to try and minimise its spread and ensure that people are vaccinated."\r\n\r\n[Byline: Megan Hughes]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[Pigs have been effective sentinels for the presence of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in the 4 affected Australian states. The above reports provide a comprehensive overview of the current JEV situation in the 4 states. There has been no indication in the above or previous reports that ProMED has received about the frequency of aborted litters or teratogenic effects in the affected piggeries.

JEV is a mosquito-borne viral disease that is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito to people and animals -- mostly pigs and horses.<br /><br />SunPork Group CEO and managing director Dr Robert van Barneveld said several of their sites in the eastern states had been impacted and they were working through it. "One of the Goondiwindi farms has been infected...we have an infected premises in New South Wales.... There are infected premises all down the east coast," Dr van Barneveld said. "We\'ve been working on this endlessly since Friday night [25 Feb 2022] when we first were made aware that it was an issue."<br /><br />Dr van Barneveld said it was not a new occurrence and there was no cause for alarm in the pork industry. "The piggeries are innocent bystanders. Pigs are not going to infect other pigs. It\'s not going to have a negative effect at an abattoir. The pork is safe to eat. It\'s play on," he said. "If you\'re going to have an emergency animal disease, this is the one to have. We\'re not actually anticipating any significant disruption to our operations at all."<br /><br />Pigs are the focus from a human health perspective, as they can infect mosquitoes that can then infect humans. This is not the case with horses.<br /><br />Humans can become infected with JEV through the bite of an infected mosquito. The virus cannot be transmitted between humans, and it cannot be caught through eating pork or pig products.<br /><br />"If a mosquito bites people and if it bites horses, they\'re called dead-end hosts, so it doesn\'t pass on. If it bites a pig -- a pig\'s an amplifier -- so if another mosquito bites that pig while it\'s viremic, which is a very short period of time, it can transmit in the mosquito population," Dr van Barneveld said. "That\'s why there are controls around the movement of pigs."<br /><br />Dr van Barneveld said authorities were working well together to protect humans and animals. "This is about protecting people and the bad guy in the process is a mosquito and the weather patterns," he said. "The state health departments and the state chief veterinary officers have worked extremely well together. They understand that eradicating it is going to be very unlikely and they\'re being very practical around the movement of pigs and making sure people are safe."<br /><br />He said SunPork had done a lot of preparedness work around African swine fever and had good relationships with the state chief veterinary officers which puts it in a very good position to manage this. "When you get a disease like this, there are a whole stack of legislative instruments that are pushed into place that have to be executed, and they\'re following those processes. Everyone\'s fairly calm about it and [I] think we can manage through it with minimal disruption."<br /><br />A vaccine for horses and pigs is available in countries where the disease is endemic, but no JE vaccines for animals are registered for use in Australia, and there is no effective treatment for JE in animals.<br /><br />On Friday [4 Mar 2022], Australia\'s Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Mark Schipp said JEV had been confirmed at 14 piggeries across NSW, SA, Queensland and Victoria. This follows a confirmed human case of JEV in Queensland. Queensland Health said the confirmed case had recent travel in regional southern Queensland and is currently being treated in a Brisbane hospital.<br /><br />Less than 1% of people infected may develop a serious illness such as encephalitis and experience symptoms including neck stiffness, severe headache and coma, and more rarely, permanent neurological complications or death.<br /><br />Goondiwindi and District Veterinary Services owner and vet Dr Trisha Pullos said the recent heavy rain in parts of Queensland and NSW had brought with it more mosquitoes and potentially more risk of JEV. "We\'ve had quite a bit of rain like everybody else, and the mozzies out here are brutal," Dr Pullos said.<br /><br />Dr Pullos said the main issues were observed in piglets -- pigs didn\'t seem to be affected physically. "If the piglets are born dead or weak or malformed or something really unusual or if the sow aborts the whole litter -- that\'s the 1st sign," she said. "Pigs can amplify the virus. It\'s not transferable between humans; it seems to be just the mosquitoes that are how we can catch it, so if you can keep the mozzies off you, then we\'ll be a little bit safer."<br /><br />She said it was important to get information from reliable sources and anyone who was worried should contact their vet. "Anybody who\'s got 2 pigs in the backyard, or a pig for the kids, or a little kill herd at the back of the property -- they need to contact their local vet and just say, \'Hey, I\'ve got 2 pigs here. What do I need to keep an eye out for?\' Then what we\'ll do is we\'ll let our district vet know who will then let the Chief Veterinary Officer know so we can try and track it a lot faster, because if someone goes and tells their neighbour but doesn\'t tell the vet then we\'re already behind the 8 ball."<br /><br />She said there was a risk people had "bad news fatigue" and wouldn\'t take things seriously. "I\'ve found that everyone\'s a little bit worn out. There\'s been quite a few comments on our Facebook posts where people are just like, \'Not again\', or \'What now?\' \'Can it just end?\' We might be at risk of going, \'Oh, whatever\', and I want to make sure that they\'re not going to do that."<br /><br />JEV was detected in 3 people in the Torres Strait Islands in 1995. In 1998, 2 further cases were detected in people in Queensland, including one acquired on the Australian mainland.<br /><br />JEV is mostly transmitted by bites from infected mosquito vectors and is maintained in mosquito-waterbird or mosquito-waterbird-pig cycles. Waterbirds, particularly wading birds such as herons and egrets, are the main source from which transmission of JEV can occur. They are important amplifying hosts and hold enough virus in their blood to infect vectors for one to 7 days.<br /><br />Pigs are also major amplifiers of the virus and develop levels of virus in the blood sufficient to infect vectors for around 4 days. Horses and a wide range of other species may be infected but do not develop levels of virus in the blood sufficient to infect mosquitoes, so are not involved in maintaining disease in an area.<br /><br />[Byline: Brandon Long]<br /><br />--<br />Communicated by:<br />ProMED<br /><br />******<br />[2] South Australia: pigs<br />Date: Sun 6 Mar 2022 23:58 ACDT<br />Source: ABC News [edited]<br /><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2022-03-07/japanese-encephalitis-outbreak-reaches-sa/100888042" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2022-03-07/japanese-encephalitis-outbreak-reaches-sa/100888042</a><br /><br /><br />Key points<br />----------<br />- The virus has been detected at 21 piggeries, 3 human cases have been confirmed, and the federal government predicts more cases will be detected.<br />- The Chief Veterinary Officer says it\'s unusual to detect Japanese encephalitis (JE) so far south.<br />- Pork SA [South Australia] says piggeries will still be able to operate, but restrictions are in place.<br /><br />The outbreak of Japanese encephalitis (JE) is now impacting 4 states as public health officials work to contain it. Since the potentially fatal mosquito-borne virus was first detected near the New South Wales-Victoria border last week, cases have been recorded in Queensland and South Australia.<br /><br />A Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment spokesperson said 3 cases of JE had been confirmed in humans, and a number of possible cases were under investigation. The spokesperson said it was anticipated that more cases would be confirmed shortly.<br /><br />Australia\'s Chief Veterinary Officer Mark Schipp said animals at 21 piggeries had been infected. "We\'re mapping the presence of waterbirds, feral pigs or piggeries and people that have contracted the infection," he said. "We\'re undertaking mosquito surveillance and mosquito control on those farms."<br /><br />There is a vaccine available as well. "That\'s the purpose of the mapping that we\'re undertaking at the moment -- to prioritise those vaccinations and then rolling the vaccinations out further from there," Mr Schipp said. The movement of pigs on farms with positive cases is being restricted.<br /><br />Pork SA chairman Andrew Johnson is urging pork producers to report suspected cases. "Farmers that see any symptoms, they shouldn\'t be afraid to advise accordingly," he said.<br /><br />JE cannot be transmitted to humans by eating pork products and producers will still be able to transport livestock to abattoirs. "If there\'s a suspect case, or if there is a positive case, those farms will be issued a movement permit that will allow them to continue business," Mr Johnson said.<br /><br />The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and cannot be passed from livestock to humans. "Japanese encephalitis is a virus carried by mosquitoes from water birds or pigs to humans or horses," Mr Schipp said. "Pigs are an amplifying host, so they produce a lot of virus and the mosquitoes pick that up and carry it forward into humans and horses."<br /><br />JE is not normally found in Australia and health officials survey the Torres Strait and the Top End every year to check for outbreaks. This outbreak has been found along the Murray River corridor.<br /><br />Mr Schipp said it was surprising to find JE so far south. "It will have a large impact on human health and industry," he said. "The impacts on tourism, for example, could be significant. We\'re doing everything we can to try and minimise its spread and ensure that people are vaccinated."<br /><br />[Byline: Megan Hughes]<br /><br />--<br />Communicated by:<br />ProMED<br /><br />[Pigs have been effective sentinels for the presence of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in the 4 affected Australian states.

New research from Alfred Health has, for the 1st time, tracked the geographical distribution of gonorrhoea over a decade, finding growing clusters of the sexually transmitted infection were infiltrating some of the most socioeconomically disadvantaged areas of Melbourne.\r\n\r\nAlfred Health epidemiologist and biostatistician Eric Chow, who led the study, said while the disease previously circulated among men who had sex with other men, a growing number of women were becoming infected. "Why this is occurring is the million-dollar question," Associate Professor Chow said. "We really don\'t know whether it is because of the lack of sexual health literacy and services, or whether it is more risky behaviour in those areas. But definitely, the outer suburbs are becoming our greatest area of concern."\r\n\r\nVictoria recorded more than 7000 gonorrhoea cases last year [2021], compared to roughly 6500 cases in 2020, but screening of people without symptoms plummeted by almost 70 per cent during the pandemic and experts warn the true number of infections is probably far higher than official state government figures.\r\n\r\nAssociate Professor Chow said the study found that since 2010, gonorrhoea infections in females had increased more than 5-fold from 291 in a year, to almost 1600 last year [2021], showing heterosexual gonorrhoea was now endemic in Australia.\r\n\r\nThe research comes as Victoria battles a wave of syphilis outbreaks that has led to at least 4 fetal deaths in Victoria in recent years after several babies contracted syphilis from their mothers. The sharp rise in deaths followed a 14-year absence of fatal cases. Exactly why this is occurring remains unclear. Growing research suggests casual sexual activity reduced and dating app use declined during the pandemic.\r\n\r\nAssociate Professor Chow did say increased sexual promiscuity linked to the explosion in dating apps might have been one factor that had led to a sustained increase in STIs. But he believes the issue is far more complex than that, noting there was a rise in gonorrhoea in the early 2010s, before the online introduction apps became commonplace. "One of the most concerning things to us is the increase in the disease among heterosexual men and women," Associate Professor Chow said. "It\'s just gone up exponentially among women in the outer suburbs of Melbourne."\r\n\r\nThe research found that there was the sharpest rise in cases between 2017 and 2019 with 24 825 notified gonorrhoea cases in Victoria, of which one in 5 were women, 13 per cent were heterosexual males, and about 42 per cent were men who had sex with men. It also found rates of infections of the STI had more than tripled in the outer suburbs of Melbourne.\r\n\r\nInfections of gonorrhoea among men who have sex with men are concentrated in inner metropolitan Melbourne, and experts said research showed this cohort were the most likely to be regularly screened for STIs, which may explain the higher rates of detection.\r\n\r\nBut of increasing concern to doctors, is the growing number of cases among women concentrated in the outer suburbs, where there remained a worrying lack of health services screening for sexually transmitted diseases and Associate Professor Chow said there was an urgent need for more support.\r\n\r\nData from the Victorian government\'s infectious diseases surveillance report shows the City of Yarra, which includes inner-city suburbs Fitzroy, Collingwood, and Abbotsford, had the highest increase in cases, reporting 535 infections last year [2021], compared to 380 in 2020.\r\n\r\nProblematically, gonorrhoea has become increasingly immune to antibiotics and a drug-resistant strain of the bacteria, dubbed a "super-superbug", has been detected in every Australian state and territory. Associate Professor Chow said there were international concerns about rising resistance to the antibiotic drugs prescribed to treat gonorrhoea. "This is quite concerning because it will make the infection more difficult to treat," he said.\r\n\r\nAssociate Professor Marcus Chen, from Melbourne Sexual Health Centre, said experts were now examining where Victorians were acquiring gonorrhoea, noting a limitation of the recent study was that it was based on the residence of the notified cases. "We\'re getting a feeling there\'s an element of marginalisation linked to outbreaks," Associate Professor Chen said. "There\'s obviously something driving new infections, but if testing and treatment were sufficient to offset it, then you wouldn\'t get a worsening epidemic, which is what we are seeing."\r\n\r\n[Byline: Melissa Cunningham]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n["Melbourne is the capital and most populous city in the Australian state of Victoria and the 2nd most populous city in Australia." (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne>). A ProMED map of Australia can be accessed at <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701917,295>.\r\n\r\nIn May 2021, ProMED posted a news report of an outbreak of syphilis in urban poor women in Melbourne\'s outer suburbs (Brimbank and Melton to the city\'s northwest, and Casey, to the city\'s southeast) that was associated with an increase in cases of congenital and ocular syphilis (see ProMED post Syphilis - Australia: (VI) ocular, women, congenital, urban poor, genotyping, alert 20210518.8367315). In that outbreak, scientists were said to be using genomic sequencing for the 1st time to track syphilis cases.\r\n\r\nThe May 2021 report attributed the increase in STDs in lower-socio economic communities in Melbourne\'s outer suburbs in part to barriers in accessing healthcare. A report on the effects that social and economic conditions in these areas of Melbourne have on health care can be found in a report entitled "HealthWest Partnership response to the Senate Committees on Community Affairs: Australia\'s domestic response to the World Health Organization\'s (WHO) Commission on Social Determinants of Health report -- Closing the gap within a generation" (<https://bit.ly/3yiFwrI>).\r\n\r\nThe current news reports above are now reporting an outbreak of gonorrhea, another sexually transmitted disease (STD), in the same Melbourne outer suburbs of Brimbank, Melton, and Casey as previously reported for syphilis, among women apparently in the same demographic group that was affected by syphilis. A map showing the location of these 3 Melbourne suburbs can be found at <https://www.theage.com.au/national/gonorrhoea-epidemic-hits-citys-outer-suburbs-20220302-p5a0vv.html>. We are not told if antibiotic resistant strains of gonococci are involved in this outbreak.\r\n\r\nIn recent ProMED posts, illicit drug use, namely methamphetamine, has been cited as a contributing factor to recent increases in STDs in women in both the United States and Canada (see the "See Also" section below). Illicit drug use is associated with sexual behaviors that increase the risk of acquiring syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases, including having multiple anonymous sex partners, inconsistent condom use, and exchange of sex for drugs or money.\r\n\r\nMore information on this outbreak of STDs in Melbourne suburbs would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML]\n\n[See Also:\nSyphilis, gonorrhea - Canada: (ON) increase, RFI 20220225.8701644\r\nSyphilis, gonorrhea - USA: (NYC) rising incidence, Black & Latin women, alert 20220204.8701262\r\nSyphilis - USA (05): (WA) unprotected sex, illicit drug use 20220202.8701202\r\nSyphilis - USA (04): congenital, deficiencies in prenatal syphilis screening 20220131.8701179\r\nSyphilis - USA (03): (PA) urban, women, congenital 20220128.8701130\r\nSyphilis - USA (02): (WI) women, congenital, injection drug use 20220127.8701113\r\nSyphilis - USA: (WA) women, congenital, drug use, homeless 20220119.8700962\r\nSyphilis - Canada: (QB) increased incidence, women, congenital, RFI 20220109.8700761\r\n2021\r\n----\r\nSyphilis - Australia (02): (VI) women, congenital syphilis, RFI 20210901.8637570\r\nSyphilis - Australia: (VI) ocular, women, congenital, urban poor, genotyping, alert 20210518.8367315\r\n2019\r\n----\r\nSyphilis - Canada (08): (SK,ON) incr. incidence, indigenous, women, meth use 20191212.6836885\r\nSyphilis - Canada (06): (BC) incr. incidence, MSM, women, congenital, comment 20191203.6819623\r\nSyphilis - Japan: more cases, heterosexual women, congenital 20191127.6800502\r\nGonococcal disease: Australia (QL) incr. incid., drug resist. ceftriax/azithro 20191120.6789051\r\nSyphilis - New Zealand: MSM, Maori men/women, congenital, Natn\'l Action Plan 20190627.6540132\r\nSyphilis - Canada (02): (MB) incr. incidence, meth., IDU, women, congenital 20190307.6354666\r\n2018\r\n----\r\nSyphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia - USA, UK, Australia (02): background 20181210.6201105\r\nSyphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia - USA, UK, Australia 20181208.6192757\r\nSyphilis - Australia (03): (SA) increasing, congenital, indigenous people 20181119.6153068\r\nSyphilis - Australia (02): increasing cases, congenital, indigenous 20181030.6119580\r\nGonococcal disease: UK, Australia, antibiotic resist. ceftriaxone/azithro.

A ProMED map of Australia can be accessed at <a href="https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701917,295" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701917,295</a>.<br /><br />In May 2021, ProMED posted a news report of an outbreak of syphilis in urban poor women in Melbourne\'s outer suburbs (Brimbank and Melton to the city\'s northwest, and Casey, to the city\'s southeast) that was associated with an increase in cases of congenital and ocular syphilis (see ProMED post Syphilis - Australia: (VI) ocular, women, congenital, urban poor, genotyping, alert <a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20210518.8367315\');">20210518.8367315</a>). In that outbreak, scientists were said to be using genomic sequencing for the 1st time to track syphilis cases.<br /><br />The May 2021 report attributed the increase in STDs in lower-socio economic communities in Melbourne\'s outer suburbs in part to barriers in accessing healthcare. A report on the effects that social and economic conditions in these areas of Melbourne have on health care can be found in a report entitled "HealthWest Partnership response to the Senate Committees on Community Affairs: Australia\'s domestic response to the World Health Organization\'s (WHO) Commission on Social Determinants of Health report -- Closing the gap within a generation" (<a href="https://bit.ly/3yiFwrI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bit.ly/3yiFwrI</a>).<br /><br />The current news reports above are now reporting an outbreak of gonorrhea, another sexually transmitted disease (STD), in the same Melbourne outer suburbs of Brimbank, Melton, and Casey as previously reported for syphilis, among women apparently in the same demographic group that was affected by syphilis. A map showing the location of these 3 Melbourne suburbs can be found at <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/national/gonorrhoea-epidemic-hits-citys-outer-suburbs-20220302-p5a0vv.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.theage.com.au/national/gonorrhoea-epidemic-hits-citys-outer-suburbs-20220302-p5a0vv.html</a>. We are not told if antibiotic resistant strains of gonococci are involved in this outbreak.<br /><br />In recent ProMED posts, illicit drug use, namely methamphetamine, has been cited as a contributing factor to recent increases in STDs in women in both the United States and Canada (see the "See Also" section below). Illicit drug use is associated with sexual behaviors that increase the risk of acquiring syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases, including having multiple anonymous sex partners, inconsistent condom use, and exchange of sex for drugs or money.<br /><br />More information on this outbreak of STDs in Melbourne suburbs would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML] <h2>See Also</h2>\nSyphilis, gonorrhea - Canada: (ON) increase, RFI <a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20220225.8701644\');">20220225.8701644</a><br />Syphilis, gonorrhea - USA: (NYC) rising incidence, Black & Latin women, alert <a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20220204.8701262\');">20220204.8701262</a><br />Syphilis - USA (05): (WA) unprotected sex, illicit drug use <a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20220202.8701202\');">20220202.8701202</a><br />Syphilis - USA (04): congenital, deficiencies in prenatal syphilis screening <a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20220131.8701179\');">20220131.8701179</a><br />Syphilis - USA (03): (PA) urban, women, congenital <a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20220128.8701130\');">20220128.8701130</a><br />Syphilis - USA (02): (WI) women, congenital, injection drug use <a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20220127.8701113\');">20220127.8701113</a><br />Syphilis - USA: (WA) women, congenital, drug use, homeless <a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20220119.8700962\');">20220119.8700962</a><br />Syphilis - Canada: (QB) increased incidence, women, congenital, RFI <a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20220109.8700761\');">20220109.8700761</a><br />2021<br />----<br />Syphilis - Australia (02): (VI) women, congenital syphilis, RFI <a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20210901.8637570\');">20210901.8637570</a><br />Syphilis - Australia: (VI) ocular, women, congenital, urban poor, genotyping, alert <a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20210518.8367315\');">20210518.8367315</a><br />2019<br />----<br />Syphilis - Canada (08): (SK,ON) incr. incidence, indigenous, women, meth use <a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20191212.6836885\');">20191212.6836885</a><br />Syphilis - Canada (06): (BC) incr. incidence, MSM, women, congenital, comment <a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20191203.6819623\');">20191203.6819623</a><br />Syphilis - Japan: more cases, heterosexual women, congenital <a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20191127.6800502\');">20191127.6800502</a><br />Gonococcal disease: Australia (QL) incr. incid., drug resist. ceftriax/azithro <a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20191120.6789051\');">20191120.6789051</a><br />Syphilis - New Zealand: MSM, Maori men/women, congenital, Natn\'l Action Plan <a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20190627.6540132\');">20190627.6540132</a><br />Syphilis - Canada (02): (MB) incr. incidence, meth., IDU, women, congenital <a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20190307.6354666\');">20190307.6354666</a><br />2018<br />----<br />Syphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia - USA, UK, Australia (02): background <a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20181210.6201105\');">20181210.6201105</a><br />Syphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia - USA, UK, Australia <a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20181208.6192757\');">20181208.6192757</a><br />Syphilis - Australia (03): (SA) increasing, congenital, indigenous people <a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20181119.6153068\');">20181119.6153068</a><br />Syphilis - Australia (02): increasing cases, congenital, indigenous <a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20181030.6119580\');">20181030.6119580</a><br />Gonococcal disease: UK, Australia, antibiotic resist. ceftriaxone/azithro.

The epidemiological investigation is ongoing.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\n\n[This very brief report indicates that there have been 4 monkeypox cases reported in the Central African Republic (CAR) so far this year (2022), of which 2 died of the disease.\r\n\r\nProMED has reported sporadic cases of monkeypox (MPX) in the Central African Republic (CAR). Since 2013, except for 2020 and 2021, CAR has been reporting at least one MPX outbreak every year, especially in its eastern region. The case fatality rate continues to be very low except for the 2 deaths of 4 cases reported above. However, these are very small numbers and do not provide reliable case fatality rates.\r\n\r\nPrevention of MPX virus infections will not be possible without knowing the source of infection. The question remains about the source of these recent infections within the CAR as well as in Nigeria, Cameroon, and Liberia. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received.\r\n\r\nStudies of prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp., an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected.\r\n\r\nThe MPX virus clade involved in this outbreak and previous ones in the CAR is not mentioned. As noted in previous ProMED posts, the monkeypox virus clade in the Congo Basin causes more severe disease in humans -- with a case fatality rate of up to17 percent -- than the clade in Ghana, which causes few fatalities. - Mod.TY\n\nProMED map:\nCentral African Republic: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701910,66>]\n\n[See Also:\n2019\r\n----\r\nMonkeypox - Africa: Central African Republic 20190205.6299251\r\n2018\r\n----\r\nMonkeypox - Africa (15): Central African Republic 20181027.6114925\r\nMonkeypox - Africa (12): Central African Republic 20180730.5936829\r\nMonkeypox - Africa (05): Central African Republic (HK) 20180403.5726159\r\nMonkeypox - Africa (04) 20180327.5712702\r\nMonkeypox - Africa (03): Central African Republic (HK) comment 20180322.5703720\r\nMonkeypox - Africa (02): Central African Republic (HK) 20180321.5700108\r\n2017\r\n----\r\nMonkeypox - Africa (05): Central African Republic 20170715.5177463\r\nMonkeypox - Africa (04): Congo DR, Central African Republic 20170705.5151556\r\n2016\r\n----\r\nMonkeypox - Central African Republic (04): (HK) WHO 20161014.4560870\r\nMonkeypox - Central African Republic (03): (BK,HK) fatal 20160929.4525807\r\nMonkeypox - Central African Republic (02): (BK) fatal 20160924.4512897\r\nMonkeypox - Central African Republic: (MB) RFI 20160119.3947756\r\n2011\r\n----\r\nMonkeypox, human, rodent - Central African Republic 20111129.3488]\n.................................................ty/mj/jh'}, 'post': '<span class="printable"><p><img src="https://promedmail.org/wp-content/plugins/promed-latest-post/assets/images/printer.gif"/><a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8701910\');"> View printable version</a> &nbsp; Share this post: <span class="addthis"><a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.promedmail.org%2Fpost%2F8701910\');"><img src="https://promedmail.org/wp-content/plugins/promed-latest-post/assets/images/share_fb.gif" class="share" /> </a></span> <span class="addthis"><a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.promedmail.org%2Fpost%2F8701910\');"><img src="https://promedmail.org/wp-content/plugins/promed-latest-post/assets/images/share_tw.gif" class="share" /> </a></span> <span class="addthis"><a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/email/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.promedmail.org%2Fpost%2F8701910\');"><img src="https://promedmail.org/wp-content/plugins/promed-latest-post/assets/images/share_em.gif" class="share" /> </a></span> </p></span><p class="publish_date_html"><span class="blue">Published Date:</span> 2022-03-11 01:42:10 AEDT <br /><span class="blue">Subject:</span> PRO/AH/EDR> Monkeypox - Africa (04): Central African Republic, WHO <br /><span class="blue">Archive Number:</span> 20220310.8701910<div class="text1">MONKEYPOX - AFRICA (04): CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC, WHO<br />******************************************************<br />A ProMED-mail post<br /><a href="http://www.promedmail.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.promedmail.org</a><br />ProMED-mail is a program of the<br />International Society for Infectious Diseases<br /><a href="http://www.isid.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.isid.org</a><br /><br />Date: Sun 6 Mar 2022<br />Source: WHO/AFRO Health Emergency Information and Risk Assessment [edited]<br /><a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/352364/OEW10-280206032022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/352364/OEW10-280206032022.pdf</a><br /><br /><br />Weekly Bulletin on Outbreaks and Other Emergencies<br />Week 10: 28 Feb- 6 Mar 2022.

Greene County in central Iowa and Fremont County in southwest Iowa brings the total number of counties to 12.\r\n\r\nCWD was first detected in Iowa in 2013 with 72 cases in Allamakee County in northeast Iowa, the most cases in any one county in any year since. The 2nd most were 29 CWD cases in neighboring Clayton County in 2016.

These vine-like epiphytic cacti originate in Central and South America but are also widely grown in Southeast Asia. They are an important fruit crop in these regions because of their high nutritional value. Several varieties with varying skin and pulp colours are planted commercially. Few pathogens are known to affect the crops, but disease management is especially difficult since dragon fruit is propagated by cuttings, which may spread any pathogens.\r\n\r\nThe fungus _Lasiodiplodia theobromae_ was first reported in Cameroon in 1895 associated with charcoal pod rot of cocoa. Subsequently it was found to have a wide host range of more than 280 species including many crops such as citrus, grapevine, vegetable hosts, strawberry, sweet potato, and mango. Depending on the host, symptoms may include wilting, fruit rots, dieback, vascular discolouration, complete defoliation, and death of plants. It is thought that nutrient deficiencies and environmental stress factors may enhance the susceptibility of some hosts. Fungicides may be helpful in disease management if applied quickly enough. An increase in virulence has been reported on some hosts, suggesting that new strains of the fungus may be emerging in different areas.\r\n\r\nMaps\r\nBangladesh:\r\n<http://www.nationsonline.org/maps/bangladesh_map.jpg> and\r\n<http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OvthAOOs_tE/T6qxrewlF8I/AAAAAAAAAKw/Qg1nYXeyA9A/s1600/BangladeshDistrictsMap.JPG>\r\n\r\nPictures\r\n_L. theobromae_ symptoms on different hosts:\r\n<https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/3-s2.0-B9780124115521000107-f10-02-9780124115521.jpg>,\r\n<https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Papaya_%28Carica_papaya%29_Lasiodiplodia_fruit_rot.jpg/640px-Papaya_%28Carica_papaya%29_Lasiodiplodia_fruit_rot.jpg>,\r\n<https://d3i71xaburhd42.cloudfront.net/ad709408b105f46db97bcf400d115ab8bc8fb0ce/10-Figure6-1.png>,\r\n<https://bugwoodcloud.org/images/768x512/1577563.jpg> and via\r\n<https://www.insectimages.org/browse/taxthumb.cfm?fam=68&genus=Lasiodiplodia>\r\nHealthy dragon fruit and plants:\r\n<https://4.imimg.com/data4/OG/AQ/MY-24448511/dragon-fruit-500x500.jpg> and\r\n<https://fairdinkumseeds.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dragonfruit1.jpg>\r\n\r\nLinks\r\nFirst detection of dragon fruit stem canker in Bangladesh:\r\n<https://doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-03-19-0619-PDN>\r\nInformation on _L. theobromae_ and associated diseases on different hosts:\r\n<https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/40844>,\r\n<http://www.mycobank.org/name/Lasiodiplodia%20theobromae>,\r\n<https://doi.org/10.5941/MYCO.2016.44.4.319>,\r\n<http://www.westerdijkinstitute.nl/images/ResearchGroups/Phytopathology/pdf/Lasiodiplodia.pdf>,\r\n<https://doi.org/10.1007/s10658-014-0557-8>,\r\n<https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.00829>,\r\n<https://doi.org/10.5943/PPQ/7/2/14> and\r\n<https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-411552-1.00010-7>\r\n_L. theobromae_ taxonomy and synonyms:\r\n<http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=188476> and\r\n<http://www.speciesfungorum.org/GSD/GSDspecies.asp?RecordID=188476>\r\nInformation on dragon fruit cultivation and diseases:\r\n<http://tastylandscape.com/2015/09/05/dragon-fruit-diseases/> (with pictures),\r\n<https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/62b9/eca25787471c4a04e266c03eb2a4caa0de22.pdf>,\r\n<https://tinyurl.com/yabd8nz8>,\r\n<https://tinyurl.com/y87zkqjp>,\r\n<https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288380543_Fungi_on_Dragon_Fruit_in_Loei_Province_Thailand_and_the_Ability_of_Bipolaris_cactivora_to_Cause_Post-harvest_Fruit_Rot> and\r\n<http://www.academia.edu/11505782/Disease_on_Dragon_Fruits_Hylocereus_sp._>\r\n- Mod.DHA]\n\n[See Also:\n2021\r\n----\r\nLasiodiplodia dieback, almond - Turkey: 1st rep (SU) 20211208.8700135\r\n2019\r\n----\r\nLasiodiplodia dieback, blueberry - Europe: 1st rep (Spain) 20190912.6671449\r\n2018\r\n----\r\nUndiagnosed diseases, dragon fruit - Viet Nam: (BU) 20181008.6078619\r\n2010\r\n----\r\nSudden decline, mango - multicountry: update 20101104.3990\r\nSudden decline, mango - United Arab Emirates 20100214.0524\r\n2009\r\n----\r\nSudden decline, mango - Oman 20091214.4240\r\nLasiodiplodia dieback, cocoa - India: 1st rep (KA) 20090814.2892\r\nDothiorella blight, dragon fruit - Malaysia: spread 20090612.2170\r\n2008\r\n----\r\nFungal diseases, mango - Australia, Pakistan 20080229.0832\r\n2005\r\n----\r\nFruit spot, eggplant - USA (GA) 20050817.2403]\n.................................................sb/dha/tw/jh"}, 'post': '<span class="printable"><p><img src="https://promedmail.org/wp-content/plugins/promed-latest-post/assets/images/printer.gif"/><a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open(\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8701908\');"> View printable version</a> &nbsp;
