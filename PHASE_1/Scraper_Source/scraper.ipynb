At this time, Similac PM 60/40 with lot code 27032K80 (can) / 27032K800 (case) is the only type and lot of this specialty formula being recalled.\\r\\n- To find out if the product you have is included in this recall, review product lot code on the bottom of the package and enter it on Abbott Nutrition\\'s website.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you feed your baby with other types of Similac, Alimentum, or EleCare powdered formula:\\r\\nCheck to see if your powdered formula is recalled using one of these 3 ways:\\r\\n- Compare the lot code and use-by date on the bottom of the package to the recall information.\\r\\n- Visit Abbott Nutrition\\'s website (<https://www.similacrecall.com/us/en/product-lookup.html>) and type in the code on the bottom of the package.\\r\\n- Call 1-800-986-8540 and follow the instructions provided.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have any recalled powdered formula, immediately stop feeding it to your baby and return it for a refund at the store where you bought it. You can also return it to Abbott Nutrition.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you can\\'t find the code on the powdered formula package, do not use it.\\r\\n\\r\\nParents and caregivers should never dilute powdered infant formula (by adding more water than recommended or another solvent to it) and should not make or feed homemade infant formula to infants.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not buy formula online that comes from outside the USA. This formula could be counterfeit; for example, it may have fake labels to misrepresent the quality or identity of a formula, the product may not have the proper nutrients or ingredients to feed your baby, or it might have a fake label with a wrong use-by date.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you get infant formula through the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program, do not throw the formula out. Instead, you should take it to the store for a refund and exchange or call the company at 1-800-986-8540 to help you. WIC recipients should be able to obtain a different brand of similar formula. Call your local WIC clinic for more guidance.\\r\\n\\r\\nContact your baby\\'s healthcare provider if\\r\\n- your baby has symptoms of _Cronobacter_ illness (fever and poor feeding, excessive crying, or very low energy);\\r\\n- your regular formula is not available, and you need recommendations on other ways to feed your baby.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms\\r\\n-----------\\r\\n-The 1st symptom of _Cronobacter_  infection in infants (0-1 year old) is usually a fever, accompanied by poor feeding, excessive crying, or very low energy. Some infants may also have seizures. Infants with these symptoms should be seen by a medical provider as soon as possible.\\r\\n-_Cronobacter_ germs can cause a dangerous blood infection (sepsis) or make the linings surrounding the brain and spinal cord swell (meningitis). Infections in infants usually occur in the 1st days or weeks of life. Infants 2 months of age and younger are most likely to develop meningitis if they are infected with _Cronobacter_.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat healthcare providers/laboratories should do\\r\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n- If a _Cronobacter_ infection is diagnosed by a laboratory culture, CDC encourages clinicians and laboratories to inform their local or state health department.\\r\\n- _Cronobacter_ can be detected in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with meningitis or sepsis caused by these bacteria.\\r\\n- _Cronobacter_ bacteria grow on routine culture media, and microbiological laboratories can detect _Cronobacter_ from blood or CSF samples.\\r\\n- CDC does not recommend testing infants for _Cronobacter_ infection unless they have symptoms of meningitis or sepsis, even if they consumed recalled formula.\\r\\n- CDC does not recommend testing stool for _Cronobacter_. _Cronobacter_ infection does not typically cause diarrhea in infants.\\r\\n- CDC does not recommend testing formula for _Cronobacter_ contamination unless an infant has a diagnosed _Cronobacter_ infection.\\r\\n- Please contact your local or state health department if your child has been diagnosed with _Cronobacter_ infection and consumed recalled formula.\\r\\n\\r\\nDescription of cases\\r\\n---------------------\\r\\nOn 10 Feb 2022, CDC was notified of FDA\\'s investigation of consumer complaints of infant illness related to products from Abbott Nutrition in Sturgis, Michigan. These complaints include 3 reports of _Cronobacter sakazakii_ infections and one report of _Salmonella_ Newport infection in infants. CDC and FDA are conducting additional laboratory testing and investigation to better understand these cases as well as any additional cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most recent investigation details are summarized below:\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 16 Sep 2021 to 5 Jan 2022, CDC received reports of 3 _Cronobacter_ cases in infants that were later found to be linked to FDA\\'s ongoing investigation. On 16 Feb 2022, CDC asked clinicians and state and local health departments to provide information on other cases of _Cronobacter_ infection associated with infant formula from November 2020 through the present. Since then, CDC has identified one additional reported case of _Cronobacter_ infection in an infant who consumed formula produced at this facility.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 28 Feb 2022:\\r\\n\\r\\n- 4 infants in Minnesota (1), Ohio (2), and Texas (1) consumed formula produced at the Sturgis, Michigan, facility before they got sick. These infants consumed formula that included Similac Sensitive, Similac Pro-total Comfort, Similac Advance, and Similac PM 60/40.\\r\\n- _Cronobacter_ infections may have contributed to the death of 2 infants in Ohio.\\r\\n\\r\\nCDC has received reports of more possible cases of _Cronobacter_ illnesses in infants and is investigating to determine if these cases are linked to formula products produced at the Abbott Nutrition facility in Sturgis, Michigan. CDC is performing whole-genome sequencing on _Cronobacter_ bacteria isolated from available patient samples to compare them with the environmental samples taken at the facility to determine if there is any relation.\\r\\n\\r\\nFDA reports one complaint of a _Salmonella_ infection in an infant who was fed recalled formula. CDC\\'s routine outbreak surveillance has not detected an outbreak of _Salmonella_ illnesses linked to this case reported to FDA or any other cases of _Salmonella_ linked to recalled formula.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout _Cronobacter_\\r\\n-----------------------\\r\\n_Cronobacter sakazakii_ is a bacterium found naturally in the environment and can live in very dry places. The organism can live in dry foods, such as powdered infant formula, powdered milk, herbal teas, and starches. _Cronobacter_ infection is not reportable in most states, meaning doctors are not required to report cases to their health department. _Cronobacter_ illnesses are rare, but when infections happen, they can be deadly for infants. CDC typically receives reports of 2-4 infections in infants per year, but the total number of cases that occur in the United States each year is not known.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow _Cronobacter_ bacteria can spread\\r\\n---------------------------------------------\\r\\nAt a production factory, _Cronobacter_ bacteria could get into formula powder if contaminated raw materials are used to make the formula or if the formula powder touches a contaminated surface in the manufacturing environment. Powdered infant formula could also become contaminated at home or elsewhere after the container is opened. For example, _Cronobacter_ bacteria could get into the formula if formula lids or scoops are placed on contaminated surfaces and later touch the formula or if the formula is mixed with contaminated water or in a contaminated bottle. See more information on how to safely prepare and store powdered infant formula.\\r\\n\\r\\n--\\r\\nCommunicated by:\\r\\nProMED\\n\\n[Several clusters of cases of infection with _C. sakazakii_ linked to contaminated powdered infant formula have been reported in the past. This cluster may have dual contamination with this organism and _Salmonella_ Newport.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Cronobacter sakazakii_ is a facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacillus that belongs to the Enterobacteriaceae family. The organism has been implicated in neonatal intensive care unit outbreaks of meningitis, septicemia, and necrotizing enterocolitis, particularly in preterm infants, although infections due to _C. sakazakii_ can occur in older infants, children, and adults.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe association of neonatal infection due to _C. sakazakii_ with the use of powdered infant formula is not new. ProMED has previously reported on infection associated with powdered infant formula contaminated by _C. sakazakii_ (formerly called _Enterobacter sakazakii_) as seen in the \"See Also\" section below.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe organism has been associated with a number of different kinds of powdered formulas from many different countries, including the USA (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. _Enterobacter sakazakii_ infections associated with the use of powdered infant formula - Tennessee, 2001. MMWR. 2002; 51(14): 297-300).\\r\\n\\r\\nGenotyping has shown that patient and formula isolates shared the same typing pattern (Clark N C, Hill B C, O\\'Hara C M, et al. Epidemiologic typing of _Enterobacter sakazakii_ in 2 neonatal nosocomial outbreaks. Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis. 1990; 13(6): 467-72; doi: 10.1016/0732-8893(90)90078-a).\\r\\n\\r\\n_Cronobacter_ are frequently isolated from the environment, plant material (wheat, rice, herbs, and spices) and various food products. Ingredients, such as starches from wheat and rice, can be a source of _Cronobacter_ that have been found to contaminate powdered infant formula.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause powdered infant formulas are not necessarily sterile and may contain pathogenic bacteria, recommendations have been made concerning preparation and handling of these products (Agostoni C, Axelsson I, Goulet O, et al. Preparation and handling of powdered infant formula: a commentary by the ESPGHAN committee on nutrition. J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr. 2004; 39(4): 320-22; doi: 10.1097/00005176-200410000-00002). - Mod.LL\\r\\n\\r\\nProMED map of United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701756,106>]\\n\\n[See Also:\\nCronobacteriosis, salmonellosis - USA (02): (WV) pwdr form, alert, recall, fatal 20220227.8701696\\r\\nCronobacteriosis, salmonellosis - USA: powdered formula, alert, recall, fatal 20220218.8701527\\r\\n2012\\r\\n----\\r\\nCronobacter sakazakii, infant formula, fatal - USA: corr 20120101.0003\\r\\n2011\\r\\n----\\r\\nCronobacter sakazakii, infant formula, fatal - USA: (MO, IL) recall 20111224.3670\\r\\n2005\\r\\n----\\r\\nEnterobacter sakazakii, infant formula - Ireland (02): background 20050127.0299\\r\\nEnterobacter sakazakii, infant formula - Ireland: recall 20050126.0277]\\n.................................................sb/ll/tw/mpp'},\n",

On 16 Feb 2022, CDC asked clinicians and state and local health departments to provide information on other cases of _Cronobacter_ infection associated with infant formula from November 2020 through the present. Since then, CDC has identified one additional reported case of _Cronobacter_ infection in an infant who consumed formula produced at this facility.<br /><br />As of 28 Feb 2022:<br /><br />- 4 infants in Minnesota (1), Ohio (2), and Texas (1) consumed formula produced at the Sturgis, Michigan, facility before they got sick. These infants consumed formula that included Similac Sensitive, Similac Pro-total Comfort, Similac Advance, and Similac PM 60/40.<br />- _Cronobacter_ infections may have contributed to the death of 2 infants in Ohio.<br /><br />CDC has received reports of more possible cases of _Cronobacter_ illnesses in infants and is investigating to determine if these cases are linked to formula products produced at the Abbott Nutrition facility in Sturgis, Michigan. CDC is performing whole-genome sequencing on _Cronobacter_ bacteria isolated from available patient samples to compare them with the environmental samples taken at the facility to determine if there is any relation.<br /><br />FDA reports one complaint of a _Salmonella_ infection in an infant who was fed recalled formula. CDC\\'s routine outbreak surveillance has not detected an outbreak of _Salmonella_ illnesses linked to this case reported to FDA or any other cases of _Salmonella_ linked to recalled formula.<br /><br />About _Cronobacter_<br />-----------------------<br />_Cronobacter sakazakii_ is a bacterium found naturally in the environment and can live in very dry places. The organism can live in dry foods, such as powdered infant formula, powdered milk, herbal teas, and starches. _Cronobacter_ infection is not reportable in most states, meaning doctors are not required to report cases to their health department. _Cronobacter_ illnesses are rare, but when infections happen, they can be deadly for infants. CDC typically receives reports of 2-4 infections in infants per year, but the total number of cases that occur in the United States each year is not known.<br /><br />How _Cronobacter_ bacteria can spread<br />---------------------------------------------<br />At a production factory, _Cronobacter_ bacteria could get into formula powder if contaminated raw materials are used to make the formula or if the formula powder touches a contaminated surface in the manufacturing environment. Powdered infant formula could also become contaminated at home or elsewhere after the container is opened. For example, _Cronobacter_ bacteria could get into the formula if formula lids or scoops are placed on contaminated surfaces and later touch the formula or if the formula is mixed with contaminated water or in a contaminated bottle. See more information on how to safely prepare and store powdered infant formula.<br /><br />--<br />Communicated by:<br />ProMED<br /><br />[Several clusters of cases of infection with _C. sakazakii_ linked to contaminated powdered infant formula have been reported in the past. This cluster may have dual contamination with this organism and _Salmonella_ Newport.<br /><br />_Cronobacter sakazakii_ is a facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacillus that belongs to the Enterobacteriaceae family. The organism has been implicated in neonatal intensive care unit outbreaks of meningitis, septicemia, and necrotizing enterocolitis, particularly in preterm infants, although infections due to _C. sakazakii_ can occur in older infants, children, and adults.<br /><br />The association of neonatal infection due to _C. sakazakii_ with the use of powdered infant formula is not new. ProMED has previously reported on infection associated with powdered infant formula contaminated by _C. sakazakii_ (formerly called _Enterobacter sakazakii_) as seen in the \"See Also\" section below.<br /><br />The organism has been associated with a number of different kinds of powdered formulas from many different countries, including the USA (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. _Enterobacter sakazakii_ infections associated with the use of powdered infant formula - Tennessee, 2001. MMWR. 2002; 51(14): 297-300).<br /><br />Genotyping has shown that patient and formula isolates shared the same typing pattern (Clark N C, Hill B C, O\\'Hara C M, et al. Epidemiologic typing of _Enterobacter sakazakii_ in 2 neonatal nosocomial outbreaks. Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis. 1990; 13(6): 467-72; doi: 10.1016/0732-8893(90)90078-a).<br /><br />_Cronobacter_ are frequently isolated from the environment, plant material (wheat, rice, herbs, and spices) and various food products. Ingredients, such as starches from wheat and rice, can be a source of _Cronobacter_ that have been found to contaminate powdered infant formula.<br /><br />Because powdered infant formulas are not necessarily sterile and may contain pathogenic bacteria, recommendations have been made concerning preparation and handling of these products (Agostoni C, Axelsson I, Goulet O, et al. Preparation and handling of powdered infant formula: a commentary by the ESPGHAN committee on nutrition. J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr. 2004; 39(4): 320-22; doi: 10.1097/00005176-200410000-00002). - Mod.LL<br /><br />ProMED map of United States: <a href=\"https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701756,106\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701756,106</a>] <h2>See Also</h2>\\nCronobacteriosis, salmonellosis - USA (02): (WV) pwdr form, alert, recall, fatal <a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"window.open(\\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20220227.8701696\\');\">20220227.8701696</a><br />Cronobacteriosis, salmonellosis - USA: powdered formula, alert, recall, fatal <a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"window.open(\\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20220218.8701527\\');\">20220218.8701527</a><br />2012<br />----<br />Cronobacter sakazakii, infant formula, fatal - USA: corr <a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"window.open(\\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20120101.0003\\');\">20120101.0003</a><br />2011<br />----<br />Cronobacter sakazakii, infant formula, fatal - USA: (MO, IL) recall <a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"window.open(\\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20111224.3670\\');\">20111224.3670</a><br />2005<br />----<br />Enterobacter sakazakii, infant formula - Ireland (02): background <a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"window.open(\\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20050127.0299\\');\">20050127.0299</a><br />Enterobacter sakazakii, infant formula - Ireland: recall <a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"window.open(\\'https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20050126.0277\\');\">20050126.0277</a><br />.................................................sb/ll/tw/mpp</div>',\n",
